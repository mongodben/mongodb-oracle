Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nQUICK START GUIDE FOR WINDOWS \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Getting Started Estimated Time to Complete: ~15 minutes This guide provides step-by-step instructions to quickly set up the required components for the BI Connector on your local system using a ODBC driver. This guide is recommended for users who would like to experiment with the BI Connector or create a local environment for development or testing on Microsoft Windows. In this tutorial you will:      * Start a local MongoDB mongod process  * Start a local BI Connector mongosqld process  * Install the ODBC driver and create a data source name (DSN)  * Connect with a BI tool of your choice \nPREREQUISITES \n * MongoDB installed on your local system. Download the latest production release of MongoDB from the MongoDB Download Center and install it. For detailed instructions, see Install MongoDB.  * MongoDB Connector for BI installed on your local system. Download the latest production release of BI Connector from the MongoDB Download Center and install it. For detailed installation instructions, see Install BI Connector On Premises.  * The MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver installed on your local system.  * Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015  * A BI tool of your choice, such as Power BI or Qlik Sense. \nGETTING STARTED \n1 \nSTART A MONGOD PROCESS \nIf mongod is not already running on your local system, start it from the command line in the MongoDB program directory. You can create the default data directory at C:\\data\\db or specify a different directory with the --dbpath option. mkdir C:\\data\\db  \"C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\3.6\\bin\\mongod.exe\" \n2 \nIMPORT A SAMPLE DATASET \nMake sure your MongoDB instance has at least one collection with some data for testing purposes. A sample dataset with United States ZIP code information (3.2 MB) is available at media.mongodb.org/zips.json. \nNOTE To save the ZIP code dataset directly to disk, right click on the link and select \"Save Link As...\" This tutorial assumes that the saved file is in the directory C:\\data. Import the dataset into MongoDB. The following command imports the zips.json file into a collection named zips in a database named test: \"C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\3.6\\bin\\mongoimport.exe\" --db test --collection zips --file \"C:\\data\\zips.json\"  See the MongoDB manual for help with mongoimport, the mongo shell program, and CRUD operations. 3 \nSTART A MONGOSQLD PROCESS \nStart a mongosqld process from the command line in the BI Connector program directory. \"C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Connector for BI\\2.3\\bin\\mongosqld.exe\"  With no command line options, mongosqld generates a schema from all the user-accessible collections in your MongoDB instance. For more information about specifying database namespaces for BI Connector to work with, see the mongosqld reference page. If mongosqld starts correctly, the last line of on-screen output declares the namespaces it has found for its schema. For example, the following output indicates that mongosqld started correctly and sampled the zips namespace. [schemaDiscovery] mapped schema for 1 namespaces: \"test\" (1): [\"zips\"] 4 \nCREATE A DATA SOURCE NAME (DSN) \nCreate a System DSN by following instructions in the tutorial. For the purposes of this local test installation you can leave the User, Password and Authentication fields blank, because mongosqld is running without the --auth option.  When you press the Test button you should see the Connection Successful result. 5 \nSTART AN SQL CLIENT OR BI TOOL \nTo learn how to connect from your BI Tool, see several applications.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nMAP RELATIONAL SCHEMAS TO MONGODB \nBusiness intelligence tools connect to a data source and, given a fixed tabular schema, allow users to visually explore their data. MongoDB uses a flexible schema, so some business intelligence tools cannot use MongoDB as a native data source. To use MongoDB with a relational business intelligence tool such as Tableau, you must define a relational mapping for your MongoDB data. MongoDB Connector for BI provides several methods for creating and managing a relational schema. For complete documentation on BI Connector's schema management options, see the mongosqld reference documentation. \nSTANDALONE SCHEMA MODE (CACHED SAMPLING) \nThe default sampling mode which mongosqld uses to analyze your collections and derive a static schema. In this mode, mongosqld derives the schema on startup and holds the schema in memory. \nAUTO SCHEMA MODE (PERSIST A SCHEMA IN MONGODB) \nmongosqld samples your MongoDB collections and creates a schema at the time of startup and writes it to a MongoDB collection. Available via the --schemaSource option. \nUSE MONGODB VIEWS \nMongoDB views allow you to control the display of information from a collection by restricting access to certain fields, renaming fields, sorting data, and other techniques. BI Connector can read data from a view just as it does from a standard collection. \nLOAD A SCHEMA FROM A DRDL FILE \nYou can generate a text schema for mongosqld to use with the mongodrdl program. You can edit a text schema manually to suit your particular data needs. \nRESAMPLE SCHEMA DATA WITH \"FLUSH SAMPLE\" \nIf the data in your MongoDB instance changes shape significantly with new fields or collections, you may wish to regenerate the schema BI Connector uses. You can regenerate the schema either by restarting mongosqld or by issuing the \"FLUSH SAMPLE\" command from within the MySQL shell. \nGEOSPATIAL DATA \nBI Connector handles collections which contain a 2d or 2dsphere geospatial index such that longitude and latitude data are represented within a single table along with other collection data. \nSAMPLING TYPE CONFLICTS \nRelational databases do not allow dynamically typed columns so when the BI Connector samples data from MongoDB to generate a schema, type conversion conflicts may occur.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI COMPONENTS \nOn this page    \n * Choosing a Driver Changed in version 2.0: Version 2.0 of the MongoDB Connector for BI introduces a new architecture that replaces the previous PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper with the new mongosqld. As a result, the MongoDB Connector for BI no longer requires mongobiuser and mongobischema. If you are using an older release of the MongoDB Connector for BI, you should upgrade to 2.0 by following the steps in Install BI Connector On Premises. \nNOTE The MongoDB Connector for BI and associated utilities are compatible with all currently supported MongoDB server versions. The following tools are available for use with the MongoDB Connector for BI:      * mongodrdl generates database schema information for use with the MongoDB Connector for BI.  * mongosqld proxies incoming queries between SQL clients and a MongoDB server.  * mongotranslate translates a given SQL query into a MongoDB aggregation pipeline.  * The MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver provides connectivity between SQL clients and the MongoDB Connector for BI.  * The MySQL JDBC Driver provides an alternative connection method for some SQL clients and the MongoDB Connector for BI.  * The C Authentication Plugin and JDBC Authentication Plugin facilitate secure transmission of authentication credentials between mongosqld and a MySQL client. \nCHOOSING A DRIVER \nDepending on your BI tool of choice, you connect to the BI Connector with the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver or with the MySQL JDBC Driver.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nWHAT IS THE MONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI? \nOn this page    \n * System Components\n   \n * BI Connector Configurations\n * Hosted Database and BI Connector\n * Hosted Database and Self-Managed BI Connector\n * Self-Managed Database and BI Connector\n * Local Database and BI Connector Traditional business intelligence tools work with flat, tabular data. These tools aren't sophisticated enough to understand three-dimensional data stored in MongoDB databases. The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence (BI) allows you to create queries with SQL to visualize, graph, and report on your three-dimensional MongoDB data using relational business intelligence tools such as Tableau and Power BI. \nNOTE As an alternative to using third-party data visualization tools and the BI Connector, you can use MongoDB Charts to create data visualizations directly from your MongoDB collections. The MongoDB Connector for BI acts as a layer that translates queries and data between a mongod or mongos instance and your reporting tool. The BI Connector stores no data, and purely serves to bridge your MongoDB cluster with business intelligence tools. \nSYSTEM COMPONENTS \nThe BI Connector deployment includes the following components: BI toolVisualization and reporting tool, such as Tableau and PowerBI.JDBC or ODBC driverProvides a standard method to connect to the BI Connector and MongoDB databases from a BI tool. Depending on what your BI tool supports, you can use JDBC or ODBC drivers to connect to the BI Connector.BI ConnectorProvides a relational schema and translates SQL queries between your BI tool and MongoDB.MongoDB databaseMongoDB database deployment, either a self-managed MongoDB server or hosted MongoDB Atlas cluster. \nYour BI tool and driver typically run on your local machine. Your BI Connector instance and your database can run on your local machine, in a data center, or hosted in the cloud. \nBI CONNECTOR CONFIGURATIONS \nThe following table outlines the supported configurations for the BI Connector and MongoDB database deployments: BI Connector configuration\nAtlas Database (hosted)\nMongoDB Database (self-managed)\nAtlas BI Connector (hosted) Clusters M10 and greater only \nBI Connector (self-managed)  The following sections describe these configurations: \nHOSTED DATABASE AND BI CONNECTOR \nIn this configuration, your database and BI Connector applications both run on MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB's fully-managed database-as-a-service. Databases hosted on MongoDB Atlas natively support the BI Connector. \nNOTE You must have an M10 or higher MongoDB Atlas cluster to enable the built-in BI Connector. Enable the BI Connector for MongoDB Atlas, then use the connection information that Atlas provides to configure your JDBC or ODBC driver.  \nHOSTED DATABASE AND SELF-MANAGED BI CONNECTOR \nIn this configuration, your MongoDB database runs on any tier of Atlas cluster and you install and manage the BI Connector locally or on your network. Install and launch the BI Connector, specifying a remote database address, then configure your JDBC or ODBC driver to connect to the BI Connector.  \nSELF-MANAGED DATABASE AND BI CONNECTOR \nIn this configuration, you install and manage both the MongoDB database and BI Connector applications, either locally or on your network. Install and launch the BI Connector, then configure your JDBC or ODBC driver to connect to the BI Connector server address.  \nLOCAL DATABASE AND BI CONNECTOR \nFor testing and all-in-one-box local experimentation, you can run MongoDB and the BI Connector on your desktop. This configuration might be helpful for proofs of concept or as a way to explore the possibilities of data visualization with the BI Connector. Learn more about setting up a local BI Connector test installation in the Quick Start Guide.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nFAQ: THE MONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI \nOn this page    \n * Is there a cloud-hosted version of the BI Connector?\n   \n * How do I authenticate with the BI Connector?\n * When upgrading MongoDB, what considerations should be taken for the BI Connector?\n * Does the BI Connector store any data?\n * How are queries processed?\n * How do I skip data incompatible with my DRDL type definition?\n * Can I use MongoDB views with BI Connector?\n * Is there any syntax validation tool for DRDL?\n * How does the BI Connector process dates?\n * How do I use TLS/SSL with the BI Connector?\n * Can I use the SQL EXPLAIN function? \nIS THERE A CLOUD-HOSTED VERSION OF THE BI CONNECTOR? \nYou can host the MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence in MongoDB Atlas. To learn how to enable and connect to an Atlas-hosted BI Connector, see Connect via BI Connector for Atlas. \nHOW DO I AUTHENTICATE WITH THE BI CONNECTOR? \nChanged in version 2.0: Prior to version 2.0, the BI Connector stored its own separate set of credentials. If you are using an older release of the MongoDB Connector for BI, you should upgrade to 2.0 by following the steps in Install BI Connector On Premises. When connecting to a MongoDB deployment using authentication, you can authenticate as the users and roles configured in that deployment. See Authentication for details on how to specify your authentication source and mechanism. \nWHEN UPGRADING MONGODB, WHAT CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR THE BI CONNECTOR? \nBefore upgrading your MongoDB deployment, set the --mongo-versionCompatibility option to the currently installed major release series of MongoDB, for example 3.4. Once the upgrade is complete, restart mongosqld without the --mongo-versionCompatibility option or set it to the newly updated major release series. \nNOTE If you launch the BI Connector with a DRDL schema file, you must update your schema file after the upgrade if you start using a newly introduced BSON Type. MongoDB 3.4 introduces the decimal BSON type. When you upgrade from MongoDB 3.2 to MongoDB 3.4 and your schema file contains float64 values (which map to the double type in MongoDB), you must update your DRDL file after you begin using the new decimal type. \nDOES THE BI CONNECTOR STORE ANY DATA? \nThe BI Connector instance only transforms SQL queries into MongoDB queries. It does not store any data itself. When starting mongosqld, you provide it a DRDL file describing the schema of your data. \nHOW ARE QUERIES PROCESSED? \nThe BI Connector constructs aggregation expressions. mongosqld always enables the aggregate allowDiskUse option. The BI Connector cannot map some supported SQL constructs into an aggregation equivalent. In this case, the BI Connector will execute those constructs in memory. \nHOW DO I SKIP DATA INCOMPATIBLE WITH MY DRDL TYPE DEFINITION?  USING MONGODB VIEWS \nMongoDB 3.4 introduces Read-Only Views that you can use to filter incompatible data. For example, you can create a view in the test database that contains only documents containing a number in the grade field of a grades collection: db.runCommand( { create: \"numericGrades\", viewOn: \"grades\", pipeline: [ { \"$match\": { \"grade\": { \"$type\": \"number\" } } } ] } )  You can then use mongodrdl to generate a schema from this view as you would a collection: mongodrdl -d test -c numericGrades  \nUSING A DRDL FILTER \nIf documents in a collection contain different data types for a field, you may filter for a specific data type. To accomplish this, you can include a $match stage at the beginning of the pipeline in your DRDL table definition. For example, to match only documents containing a number in the grade field, use the following pipeline stage: \"$match\": { \"grade\": { \"$type\": \"number\" } }  If you are unwinding an array field that contains different data types, then to filter the array for a specific data type, put the $match stage after the $unwind. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: Heterogeneous data types \nCAN I USE MONGODB VIEWS WITH

\nIS THERE ANY SYNTAX VALIDATION TOOL FOR DRDL? \nDRDL files use the YAML syntax. Any YAML validator such as https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/ can help you check your DRDL files. \nHOW DOES THE BI CONNECTOR PROCESS DATES? \nThe BI Connector will correctly process BSON date data by mapping it to the SQL datetime type. For example: db.data.save({ date: new Date() })  If you store date data as a string, the BI Connector treats it as a string rather than as a date. For example, BI Connector treats the following as a string: db.data.save({ date: '32-FEB-2015' })  \nHOW DO I USE TLS/SSL WITH THE BI CONNECTOR? \nThe connection between mongosqld and your MongoDB deployment has TLS/SSL configured separately from the connection between your SQL client and mongosqld. \nCONNECTING MONGOSQLD TO MONGODB \nIf the MongoDB instance you are connecting to uses TLS/SSL, provide the --mongo-ssl option to mongosqld. For example: mongosqld --schema=schema.drdl --mongo-ssl  To specify a TLS/SSL CA root certificate, use the --mongo-sslCAFile option. To specify a client certificate, use the --mongo-sslPEMKeyFile option. For example: mongosqld --schema=schema.drdl \\          --mongo-ssl \\          --mongo-sslCAFile=/certs/ca.pem \\          --mongo-sslPEMKeyFile=/certs/mongodb_client.pem  \nCONNECTING A CLIENT TO MONGOSQLD \nTo specify a TLS/SSL CA root certificate, use the --sslCAFile option. To specify a client certificate, use the --sslPEMKeyFile option. For example: mongosqld --schema=schema.drdl \\          --sslCAFile=/certs/ca.pem \\          --sslPEMKeyFile=/certs/mongosql_server.pem  \nCAN I USE THE SQL EXPLAIN FUNCTION? \nIf you are using an SQL client which allows you to issue SQL statements directly, such as the MySQL shell, you can precede any query with EXPLAIN to get information about how the query will be executed. EXPLAIN returns the complete aggregation operation which BI Connector will send to MongoDB, without running the query or returning any results. EXPLAIN is useful if you want to know exactly how a specific SQL query translates into MongoDB Query Language. ←  Supported SQL Functions and OperatorsRelease Notes for MongoDB Connector for BI → On this page  * Is there a cloud-hosted version of the BI Connector?\n * How do I authenticate with the BI Connector?\n * When upgrading MongoDB, what considerations should be taken for the BI Connector?\n * Does the BI Connector store any data?\n * How are queries processed?\n * How do I skip data incompatible with my DRDL type definition?\n * Can I use MongoDB views with BI Connector?\n * Is there any syntax validation tool for DRDL?\n * How does the BI Connector process dates?\n * How do I use TLS/SSL with the BI Connector?\n * Can I use the SQL EXPLAIN function?

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nLAUNCH BI CONNECTOR \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Prerequisites\n * Launching mongosqld\n * Next Steps \nOVERVIEW \nmongosqld is the BI Connector program which connects your MongoDB instance to your BI tool. mongosqld requires a data schema which maps to your MongoDB collections and databases. You have several options for creating a schema and launching mongosqld. This guide will help you choose the best option for your needs. By default, mongosqld generates a data schema and holds it in memory. Alternatively, if you prefer to create a schema file and edit it manually, use the mongodrdl program to create a .drdl schema file and use the --schema option when starting mongosqld. For more information on schema generation and data sampling, see Map Relational Schemas to MongoDB. \nPREREQUISITES \n     * Install BI Connector \nLAUNCHING MONGOSQLD \nThere are three options for launching and running mongosqld. You can:  * Run mongosqld as a hosted service with MongoDB Atlas  * Start mongosqld from the command line  * Install mongosqld as a system service \nRUN BI CONNECTOR AS A HOSTED SERVICE WITH MONGODB ATLAS \nYou can host the MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence in MongoDB Atlas. To learn how to enable and connect to an Atlas-hosted BI Connector, see Connect via BI Connector for Atlas. \nSTART MONGOSQLD FROM THE COMMAND LINE \nYou can use command line options to specify collections and databases to sample, user credentials, and other configuration options. For a complete list of command line options, see Command Line Options. To start mongosqld from the command line, run the mongosqld executable in the BI Connector program directory with any necessary command line options.    NOTE mongosqld defaults to port 3307. You can set the port number manually by providing the --addr option with the host address and port. \nMONGOSQLD WITH A CONFIGURATION FILE   You can use a configuration file to hold all your mongosqld configuration options. Start mongosqld with the --config option to specify a configuration file.   INSTALL MONGOSQLD AS A SYSTEM SERVICE   BI Connector requires a configuration file with the mongosqld.systemLog.path setting specified when running as a system service.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nAUTHENTICATION \nOn this page    \n * MongoDB Authentication\n   \n * BI Connector Authentication\n * Client Authentication The MongoDB Connector for BI supports the following authentication mechanisms for authenticating with MongoDB and for authenticating connecting users:      * SCRAM-SHA-1  * SCRAM-SHA-256  * PLAIN (LDAP)  * GSSAPI (Kerberos) The BI Connector (mongosqld) uses admin credentials to authenticate with MongoDB and sample data to generate the BI Connector's schema. When a client connects to the BI Connector, mongosqld passes connecting client credentials to MongoDB for authentication and will display and restrict data according to the connecting user's permissions. The following sections will guide you through configuring the BI Connector to authenticate with your MongoDB deployment, configuring authentication of users connecting to the BI Connector, and how usernames should be formatted from your BI tool using authentcation options. \nMONGODB AUTHENTICATION \nIf authentication is enabled on your MongoDB deployment, you must configure the BI Connector to use the required authentication mechanism and provide admin user credentials. The admin user credentials must be authorized to view the superset of data you wish to query using the BI Connector.   BI CONNECTOR AUTHENTICATION   \nCLIENT AUTHENTICATION \nIf your BI tool is using the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver, the driver will handle authentication and you do not need to install an authentication plugin. If you are not using the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver and need to authenticate using your BI tool, install either the C or JDBC authentication plugin depending on which is compatible with your BI Tool: C Authentication PluginInstructions for installing the C Authentication Plugin, which facilitates authentication between the BI Connector and SQL clients such as Tableau and the MySQL shell.JDBC Authentication PluginInstructions for installing the JDBC Authentication Plugin. For more information on connecting BI Tools to the BI Connector, see Connect BI Tools. \nIMPORTANT The use of TLS/SSL is recommended in addition to using an authentication plugin as:  * The SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanisms hash the passwords in the client plugin. However, all other data is in cleartext.  * The PLAIN mechanism sends the password in cleartext. The MongoDB Connector for BI requires authentication when running with --auth. When the MongoDB Connector for BI receives a connection with authentication credentials from a client, it passes those credentials through to the underlying MongoDB instance. \nAUTHENTICATION OPTIONS \nYou can specify the following authentication options after your username as URI-style query parameters: Connection Option\nDescription\nsource Specify the name of the database which stores the user's credentials. If you do not specify this option, the MongoDB Connector for BI will default to the current database associated with the MySQL connection. For authentication mechanisms such as PLAIN (LDAP) or GSSAPI (Kerberos) that delegate credential storage to other services, set the source value to $external. Not required if defaultSource is set in your MongoDB Connector for BI configuration file. mechanism Specify the mechanism that the MongoDB Connector for BI should use to authenticate the connection. Accepted values include:  * SCRAM-SHA-1 (default)  * SCRAM-SHA-256  * PLAIN (LDAP SASL)  * GSSAPI (Kerberos) LDAP and Kerberos require MongoDB Enterprise. Set the source to $external when using LDAP or Kerberos. Not required if defaultMechanism is set in your MongoDB Connector for BI configuration file. \nNOTE \nX.509 IS NOT SUPPORTED.  \nEXAMPLE \nThe following example shows how to format a username to authenticate with the BI Connector using Challenge and Response (username and password), LDAP, or Kerberos:  ←  MySQL Shell OptionsC Authentication Plugin → On this page  * MongoDB Authentication\n *

To set up MongoDB Connector for BI with a business intelligence tool such as Tableau, follow the steps on this page. \nPREREQUISITES \n     * OpenSSL installed on your host. To install OpenSSL via Homebrew, run the following command: /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"brew updatebrew install openssl  \nMONGODB USER PERMISSIONS \nIf your MongoDB instance uses authentication, your BI Connector instance must also use authentication. The user that connects to MongoDB via the mongosqld program must have permission to read from all the namespaces you wish to sample data from. For more details about MongoDB user permissions in BI Connector, see User Permissions for Cached Sampling. \nINSTALL THE BI CONNECTOR \n1 \nDOWNLOAD THE MONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI. \nDownload the BI Connector from the MongoDB Download Center. 2 \nINSTALL THE MONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI. \n a. Extract the downloaded .zip archive. Replace {SOURCE-PATH} with the path to the directory where you downloaded the .zip archive. Replace {DESTINATION-PATH} with the path to the directory where you want to extract the archive.\n    \n    unzip {SOURCE-PATH}/mongodb-bi-osx-x86_64-{version}.zip -d {DESTINATION-PATH}\n    \n      b. Change to the mongodb-bi-osx-x86_64-{version} directory. Replace {DESTINATION-PATH} with the path to the directory where you extracted the archive in the previous step.\n    \n    cd {DESTINATION-PATH}/mongodb-bi-osx-x86_64-{version}/\n    \n      c. Install the programs within the bin/ directory into a directory listed in your system PATH.

ambiguous column behavior in subqueries, GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses.  * Adds support for Ubuntu 18.04, SLES 15, and RHEL8.  * Adds non-string support for regexp.  * Improves performance for schemas that contain arrays. \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.12.0 \nReleased September 16, 2019 \nBUG FIXES \nFixes the following bugs:  * mongosqld hangs if an election occurred during sampling.  * Some queries using $lookup fail.  * Panics occur when connecting with a DRDL file that excludes a child table's _id.  * Versions 2.10+ install to the wrong directory on Windows.  * Fixes a bug in the div operator’s in-memory evaluation.  * mongosqld incorrectly kills long-running queries.  * Some queries on ObjectId fields do not push down.  * mongodrdl not parsing replica set seedlists passed to the --host flag.  * timestampadd fails with out-of-range months.  * Allows aggregate functions as grouping expressions.  * datediff fails to push down with polymorphic arguments.  * Displays incorrect foreign key constraints.  * Incorrect pushdown and type conversions for date and datetime types that are too large or too small.  * Aliases for tables in information_schema are ignored.  * Some queries with aggregate functions fail to push down.  * Pipeline parsing error for unwind paths with numeric field names.  * mongodrdl ignores the --gssapiHostName and --gssapiServiceName flags.  * Allows extra arguments to the current_timestamp and trim functions.  * str_to_date returns a date instead of a datetime for some non-constant format-string arguments. \nIMPROVEMENTS \nPUSHDOWN \nThis release includes a number of improvements to pushdown.

 * Adds support for pushing down regexp to the aggregation language.  * Removes some unnecessary rounding from pushdown translations.  * Adds support for pushing down LIKE expressions with literal pattern strings to the aggregation language.  * Improves the efficiency of pipelines generated for EXISTS subqueries.  * Improves truncate pushdown coverage and updated the translation to use $trunc with MongoDB versions 4.1.9 and later.  * Adds pushdown support for the char and str_to_date functions. GO DRIVER \nThis release includes a number of improvements made possible by upgrading to the new go driver:  * Adds support for SRV URI support to mongodrdl and mongosqld.  * Adds MongoDB URI support to mongodrdl via a --uri flag.  * Adds support for zlib and snappy compression for connections to MongoDB.  * Updates DRDL file parsing to support the most recent version of the extjson spec. \nBEHAVIORAL CHANGES \n * Adds new reserved words to the parser: INSERT, INTO, KEY, FULLTEXT, and PRIMARY.\n   \n   Going forward, these words must be wrapped in backticks to be used as identifiers in queries.  * Removes support for altering sampled schema with ALTER TABLE statements.  * Prior to 2.12, mongosqld supported renaming and removing tables and columns via a modified ALTER TABLE syntax when in standalone schema mode. Any customer currently using this feature is advised to migrate their schema management needs to views, DRDL, or custom schema mode. The variable/config parameter that enabled this feature, enable_table_alterations, is still supported but doesn’t do anything in BI Connector 2.12. It will be removed in a future release. \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.11.1 \nReleased July 8, 2019 \nBUG FIXES \nFixes a bug that caused the MySQL schema to include incorrect foreign key constraints. Fixes a bug that caused incorrect pushdown for some very large or very small date and datetime values. Fixes a bug that caused aliases to be ignored for tables in the information_schema database. \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.11.0 \nReleased May 16, 2019 \nNEW FEATURES \n * Adds a number of optimizations that are applied to generated aggregation pipelines before sending them to MongoDB.  * Adds new subcommands to mongodrdl for storing a DRDL file in MongoDB and for manipulating stored schemas.  * Enables mongosqld to use stored DRDL schemas instead of sampling. To learn more, see Schema Management Changes in 2.11.  * Introduces the beta version of mongotranslate, a command-line utility that can translate SQL queries to aggregation pipelines without a running BI Connector or MongoDB instance. \nBUG FIXES \n * Fixes a problem that caused the BI Connector to generate unnecessarily long $group key names.  * Fixes a bug that caused the BI Connector to generate incorrect table pipelines in polymorphic schema mapping mode.  * Fixes a bug that caused the BI Connector to panic when printing some query plans.  * Fixes a bug where the BI Connector’s in-memory evaluation of string-to-date conversions did not match the pushdown behavior.  * Updates the supported Amazon Linux version to match the version supported by MongoDB 4.2.  * Fixes a bug with Active Directory constrained delegation in the BI Connector’s GSSAPI implementation (linux and macOS).  * Introduces a --gssapiConstrainedDelegation flag that must be enabled to ensure existing Kerberos configurations are not broken.  * Fixes a bug that caused Kerberos authentication to fail with a linux mongosqld, MongoDB 4.0, and an Active Directory KDC.  * Fixes a number of small bugs related to correlated subqueries. \nCHAGES/DEPRECATIONS \n * Changes some schema-management configuration options.  * Deprecates schema-modification support via ALTER TABLE, as well as the enable_table_alterations system variable and setParameter \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.10.0 \nReleased Mar 15, 2019 \nBUG FIXES \n * Fixes a bug where aggregate functions returned NULL in dual queries with the DUAL keyword omitted.  * Fixes a bug where some invalid DUAL queries did not return an error.  * Fixes a bug that prevented pushdown of some joins to derived tables selecting from DUAL.  *

 * Fixes a bug where we lost precision while converting a Uint64 to a Decimal.  * Fixes a correctness bug with the INSERT scalar function's pushdown translation.  * Fixes a bug where unstable sorting caused non-deterministic renaming of colliding collection/field names during schema mapping.  * Fixes a bug where some valid subquery comparisons returned errors.  * Fixes a bug where some valid subquery and tuple comparisons returned errors.  * Fixes a bug where queries using xor returned errors on MongoDB 3.2 because the generated pipelines required features added in MongoDB 3.4.  * Fixes a bug that caused kerberos authentication to fail with MongoDB 4.0. \nDATE AND TIME CHANGES \nThis release resolves a number of inconsistencies in the BI Connector's date and timestamp semantics. Resolving these inconsistencies resulted in some changes to user-facing behavior:  * Removes inconsistent support for partial dates.\n   \n   * MySQL can represent partial dates that are missing month or day components. It is impossible to represent these incomplete dates with MongoDB dates. Attempting to correctly manipulate and render incomplete dates was causing a number of bugs and inconsistencies with complete dates.\n   \n   * Starting with version 2.10, the BI Connector does not support operations on or expressions that return incomplete dates. Going forward, we cannot provide guarantees about the behavior of operations that attempt to construct incomplete dates.  * Updates the DATE(a) and TIMESTAMP(a) scalar functions to be equivalent to CAST(a AS DATE), and CAST(a AS DATETIME), respectively.\n   \n   * The behavior of the DATE and TIMESTAMP scalar functions will depend on the value of the type_conversion_mode variable. This will change the default behavior for those scalar functions.\n   \n   * Queries affected by this change can be rewritten to use a more explicit conversion function (such as str_to_date) that does not depend on type_conversion_mode. If an affected query cannot be rewritten, a user may set type_conversion_mode variable to mysql, which instructs the BI Connector to perform all type conversions with MySQL semantics instead of MongoDB semantics.\n     \n     \n     IMPORTANT\n     \n     This is discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as it significantly curtails the ability to push down type conversions across the board.\n   \n   * For more information on type conversions and the type_conversion_mode system variable, see Type Conversion Modes. \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.9.0 \nReleased Dec 18, 2018 \nFEATURES

We encourage Tableau users running BIC 2.6.0 to upgrade to 2.6.1. \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.6.0 \nReleased Sep 04, 2018  * Added EXPLAIN() support.  * Push down type conversions to MongoDB servers running version 4.0 or later.  * Improved the handling of polymorphic data by updating the BI Connector's type conflict resolution system.  * Added Common Table Expression (CTE) support.  * Improved UNION performance.  * Added the SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanism to the following:\n   \n   * mongosqld command line options and configuration file settings:\n     \n     Command Line Option\n     Configuration File Setting\n     --mongo-authenticationMechanism\n     mongodb.net.auth.mechanism\n     --defaultAuthMechanism\n     security.defaultMechanism\n   \n   * mongodrdl --authenticationMechanism command line option.\n   \n   * MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver\n   \n   * C Authentication Plugin\n   \n   * Java Authentication Plugin  * Released the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver for Linux.  * Added the mongosqld --prejoin command line option for combining array data and non-array data into a single table. \nEXPLAIN SUPPORT \nUsers can use EXPLAIN to return details of aggregation pipeline used to generate query results. \nCOMMON TABLE EXPRESSION SUPPORT \nThe BI Connector now supports queries that include Common Table Expressions. \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.5.0 \nReleased May 23, 2018  * Improved memory management for mongosqld.  * New SSPI support for mongosqld on Windows.  * The --sampleNamespaces option now supports exclusion.  * NULL valued types are now cast to varchar during sampling.  * Optimized COUNT(*) query performance.  * SIN, COS, TAN are now pushed down. \nNEW SSPI SUPPORT \nWindows Clients may now use kerberos to authenticate against the BI Connector. \nNULL VALUED TYPES ARE NOW CAST TO VARCHAR DURING SAMPLING \nThis resolves the issue where queries would fail due to NULL values being ignored during sampling. Now, NULL values will be cast as SQL type VARCHAR. \nSIN, COS, TAN ARE NOW PUSHED DOWN \nBI Connector will now push down SIN, COS, and TAN SQL functions. This will improve performance for queries using these functions. \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.4.1 \nReleased Mar 09, 2018 We've released version 2.4.1 of the MongoDB Connector for BI for production deployment. This release contains minor bug fixes for users of the BI Connector and is a recommended upgrade for all 2.4 users. \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.4.0 \nReleased Feb 21, 2018  * Support for 3.6 Aggregate Expressions.  * Pushdown for subqueries and non-equijoins.  * Killing SQL query now also kills MongoDB operation.  * Permission changes for DRDL file users. When mongosqld runs with authentication enabled, admin credentials must be provided with the --mongo-username and --mongo-password options or the mongodb.net.auth.username and mongodb.net.auth.password settings in the configuration file.

MongoDB Connector for BI Version 2.2 further increases ease of use with a set of authentication plugins which can authenticate users through the connector without the need for SSL certificates. These plugins perform user authentication via the SASL framework and support the SCRAM-SHA-1 and PLAIN authentication mechanisms. We currently provide authentication plugins in the following languages:  * Java - for use with MySQL’s Connector/J driver  * C - for use with the MySQL ODBC driver and the MySQL Shell \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.1.0 \n * Provides substantial performance improvements for some common JOIN scenarios.  * Pushes $match stages earlier in the aggregation pipeline to improve to index utilization.  * Pushes down more SQL functions and operators to the aggregation pipeline.  * Supports additional SQL language features, such as USE and SHOW CREATE TABLE statements, STRAIGHT_JOIN, the unary plus (+) operator, and the INTERVAL keyword in date arithmetic. \nNOTE mongosqld no longer offers the --fork option. To run mongosqld in the background, use the nohup command: nohup mongosqld [options] &  \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.0.0 \nReleased Nov 29, 2016 \nIMPROVED SERVER-SIDE EXECUTION \nThe MongoDB Connector for BI delivers significant performance and scalability improvements by moving as much execution as possible to the underlying MongoDB instance. Pushing execution down to the server reduces network latency and reduces bandwidth consumption.

\nSIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE \nThe MongoDB Connector for BI package is now trimmed down from four separate components to two: mongodrdlThis tool connects to a MongoDB instance and generates a Document-Relational Definition Language (DRDL) file, which maps a given collection shape to relational schema.mongosqld Once installed and run as a daemon, mongosqld responds to SQL queries, requests for DB information, and schema from the requesting BI tool via the MySQL wire protocol. mongosqld requires at least one DRDL file to start. You will need to have defined your schema with mongodrdl before starting mongosqld. \nSQL COMPATIBILITY \nMongoDB Connector for BI Version 2.x is compatible with SQL-99 SELECT statements, and uses the MySQL wire protocol. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO:  \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI 2.0.2 \nReleased Jan 5, 2017  * Hides .pem key file passwords in logs.  * mongodrdl ignores binary fields when generating DRDL files.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nCONFIGURE TLS FOR BI CONNECTOR \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Create and Test Self-Signed Certificates For BI Connector to transmit data securely, you should enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption on your MongoDB instance, your mongosqld instance, and in your BI tool. A complete description of TLS configuration is outside the scope of this document, but this tutorial outlines the process for creating your own TLS certificates for testing purposes and starting the MongoDB components with TLS enabled. \nIMPORTANT Use these procedures for testing purposes only. Your production environment should use TLS certificates that a recognized certificate authority (CA) has issued. \nPREREQUISITES \n     * A MongoDB user with sufficient permissions to run mongosqld.  * A mongod instance which you can start and stop.  * A mongosqld instance which you can start and stop.  * OpenSSL  * The MySQL shell\n   \n   \n   TIP\n   \n   \n   SEE ALSO:\n   \n   User Permissions for Cached Sampling \nNOTE ON CLUSTER AVAILABILITY \nTo ensure read availability for your MongoDB replica sets and sharded clusters while BI Connector enables TLS, use a rolling upgrade procedure. While the replica set primary upgrades, applications must wait until after failover and election cycle completes. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: Replica Set Availability \nCREATE AND TEST SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATES \nThis tutorial contains instructions on creating several files which allow a mongosqld process to accept OpenSSL encrypted connections from an SQL client, such as the MySQL shell, and make an encrypted connection with a mongod instance.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nCONNECT FROM THE MYSQL CLIENT \nOn this page    \n * Connect from MySQL without Authentication or TLS/SSL\n   \n * Connect from MySQL with Authentication\n * Connect from MySQL with Authentication and TLS/SSL You can use the command-line MySQL client to connect to the MongoDB Connector for BI. \nCONNECT FROM MYSQL WITHOUT AUTHENTICATION OR TLS/SSL \nTo connect to a mongosqld instance listening on the MySQL default port 3307, run the following command:   CONNECT FROM MYSQL WITH AUTHENTICATION \nInstall the C Authentication Plugin as described in C Authentication Plugin. \nIMPORTANT The C Authentication plugin was developed against MySQL 5.7.X Community Edition (64-bit), and tested with MySQL 5.7.X Community Edition and the latest version of MongoDB Connector for BI. The plugin is not compatible with MySQL Server or Connector/ODBC driver version 8 and later. The following example uses the C authentication plugin to connect to a mongosqld instance listening on port 3307 as user reportsUser. The MySQL shell prompts for the password after the command has been entered.  \nFor additional options, see the MySQL Commands. \nCONNECT FROM MYSQL WITH AUTHENTICATION AND TLS/SSL  IMPORTANT The binary distribution of MySQL Community uses the yaSSL SSL library to encrypt connections. MySQL Enterprise uses OpenSSL which is compatible with MongoDB Connector for BI. Use MySQL Enterprise to connect to BI Connector over TLS / SSL. To connect to a mongosqld instance listening on port 3307, as user grace using authentication mechanism PLAIN, and using specific TLS/SSL CA and x.509 certificates, run the following command:  \nIf using the $external authentication source, wrap your username in single quotes or escape the $ character with a backslash to prevent your shell from performing interpolation. Authentication requires your client to send your password in plain text. To send the password in plain text, either:      * Use the --enable-cleartext-plugin option shown in the previous example, or  * Set the environment variable LIBMYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN=1.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nUSE MONGODB VIEWS \nOn this page    \n * Examples Another way to control the data visible to BI Connector without using a .drdl file is to read from a view. Views allow you to take a source collection and choose which fields to display, change the names of fields, sort data, and perform any kind of transformation that the aggregation pipeline can accomplish. \nEXAMPLE You can use views to redact sensitive information from a collection and direct BI Connector to read from the view, rather than the source collection. Use the mongo shell method createView to define a view on a collection and then use that view as a specified namespace when starting mongosqld. \nEXAMPLES \nConsider a collection named salaries in the employees database. By creating a view on the salaries collection that excludes all personally identifiable information, BI Connector can safely facilitate data analysis on the view without compromising the private data in the source collection. The following command starts mongosqld with data from a view named salaries_redacted in the employees database: mongosqld --sampleNamespaces \"employees.salaries_redacted\"  \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: --sampleNamespaces Another use case for managing your schema with a MongoDB view is if your working data set includes a sparsely populated but important field which may be excluded in the BI Connector sampling process. Consider a collection named sparseCollection which contains one field which occurs in every document and another field which occurs only occasionally. A portion of the collection might look like this: { \"_id\" : 0, \"mainField\": 247 }{ \"_id\" : 1, \"mainField\": 71 }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"mainField\": 981 }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"mainField\": 712 }{ \"_id\" :

create a view in which sparseField is populated with zeroes in every document in which it does not occur. db.runCommand (  {    create: \"denseCollection\",    viewOn: \"sparseCollection\",

the --sampleNamespaces option. mongosqld --sampleNamespaces \"myDatabase.denseCollection\" \n←  Auto Schema Mode (Persist a Schema in MongoDB)Load a Schema from a DRDL File → On this page  * Examples

\nOVERVIEW \nThe --schemaSource option directs mongosqld to use a particular database on the connected MongoDB instance for schema storage. mongosqld can either create a new database to use for schema storage or use an existing database. If you specify an existing database which has been used previously for schema storage, the --schemaMode option determines whether mongosqld writes new schema data to the specified database or only reads from it. If you specify a database which doesn't currently exist, you must set --schemaMode to auto. The following example command uses a database named sampleDb to store schema information and sets --schemaMode to auto. mongosqld --schemaSource sampleDb --schemaMode auto  To learn more about sampling modes, see the Sampling Mode Reference Chart. \nREGENERATE THE SCHEMA \nBy default, mongosqld does not automatically resample data after generating the schema. Specify the --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs option to direct mongosqld to automatically resample the data and regenerate the schema on a fixed schedule. To force a one-time update of the schema, use the FLUSH SAMPLE command from your SQL client. \nUSER PERMISSIONS FOR PERSISTED SCHEMAS \nIf your MongoDB instance uses authentication, you must specify a MongoDB user with write permission on the specified schema database in addition to the permissions described under cached sampling. To create a user with the necessary permissions to run mongosqld with a persisted schema, you can either create a custom role with the minimum required permissions as described in User Permissions for Cached Sampling, or use the built-in readAnyDatabase role. In either case, the user also needs write permission on the specified schema database. db.getSiblingDB(\"admin\").createUser(  {    user: \"<username>\",    pwd: \"<password>\",    roles: [             { \"role\": \"readAnyDatabase\", \"db\": \"admin\"  },             { \"role\": \"readWrite\", \"db\": \"<dbname>\"  }           ]  })  In the following example, a user named bicUser with the password

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nSTANDALONE SCHEMA MODE (CACHED SAMPLING) \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * User Permissions for Cached Sampling \nOVERVIEW \nNew in version 2.3: By default, mongosqld samples each collection on the connected MongoDB instance and generates a relational representation of the schema which it then caches in memory. \nNOTE If you have authentication enabled, ensure that your MongoDB user has the correct permissions. See User Permissions below. By default, mongosqld does not automatically resample data after generating the schema. Specify the --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs option to direct mongosqld to automatically resample the data and regenerate the schema on a fixed schedule. If the schema which mongosqld creates does not meet your BI workload needs, you can manually generate a schema file file and edit it as necessary. To learn more about sampling modes, see the Sampling Mode Reference Chart. \nUSER PERMISSIONS FOR CACHED SAMPLING \nIf your MongoDB instance uses authentication and you wish to use cached sampling, your BI Connector instance must also use authentication. The admin user that connects to MongoDB via the mongosqld program must have permission to read from all the namespaces from which you want to sample data. \nSAMPLE ALL NAMESPACES \nIf you wish to sample all namespaces, the admin user requires the following privileges:      * listDatabases on the cluster  * listCollections on each database  * find on each database Alternatively, create a user with the built-in readAnyDatabase role: use admin\ndb.createUser(  {    user: \"<username>\",    pwd: \"<password>\",    roles: [            { \"role\": \"readAnyDatabase\", \"db\": \"admin\"  }           ]  })  \nNOTE Be aware of all privileges included with the readAnyDatabase role before granting it to a user. To sample all namespaces, start mongosqld without the --sampleNamespaces option. mongosqld --auth --mongo-username <username> --mongo-password <password>  \nSAMPLE SPECIFIC NAMESPACES \nIf you wish to sample specific namespaces, the admin user requires the following privileges:  * listCollections for each database where all collections are sampled  * find on each collection or each database where all collections are sampled Alternatively, create a user with the built-in readAnyDatabase role. For an example of creating a user with this role, see the Sample All Namespaces section. \nNOTE Be aware of all privileges included with the readAnyDatabase role before granting it to a user. The following example creates a custom role in the mongo shell with the minimum required privileges to sample every collection in the test database: 1 CREATE A CUSTOM ROLE WITH THE REQUIRED PRIVILEGES. \nuse admin\ndb.createRole(  {    role: \"samplingReader\",    privileges: [      {        resource: {          db: \"test\",          collection: \"\"        },        actions: [ \"find\", \"listCollections\" ]      }    ],    roles: []  }) \n2 CREATE A NEW USER AND ASSIGN THE NEWLY CREATED ROLE TO THEM \ndb.createUser(  {    user: \"<username>\",    pwd: \"<password>\",    roles: [ \"samplingReader\" ]  })  \nNOTE The user in the example above does not have the listDatabases privilege, so you must specify a database to sample data from with the --sampleNamespaces option when running mongosqld. 3 START MONGOSQLD WITH AUTHENTICATION ENABLED \nRun mongosqld with authentication enabled and use the --sampleNamespaces option to sample data from all collections in the test database: mongosqld --auth --mongo-username <username> --mongo-password <password> \\  --sampleNamespaces 'test.*'  \nTIP \nSEE ALSO:  * --auth  * Enable Authentication ←  Map Relational Schemas to

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nRESAMPLE SCHEMA DATA WITH \"FLUSH SAMPLE\" \nOn this page    \n * Overview \nOVERVIEW \nWhen the mongosqld process starts it creates a schema, either from a schema file or by sampling data from a MongoDB instance. If the data in your MongoDB instance changes shape significantly with new fields or collections, you may wish to regenerate the schema BI Connector uses. You can regenerate the schema either by restarting mongosqld or by issuing the FLUSH SAMPLE command from within the MySQL shell. By default, mongosqld does not automatically resample data after generating the schema. Specify the --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs option to direct mongosqld to automatically resample the data and regenerate the schema on a fixed schedule. \nNOTE To use the FLUSH SAMPLE command, you must have the insert and update privileges. To learn more, see User Authorization Model.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nLOAD A SCHEMA FROM A DRDL FILE \nThe schema generation tool mongodrdl outputs a schema file in Document Relational Definition Language (DRDL) format. Examine the generated schema's table structure and field types to verify that the generated schema supports your reporting requirements. You can manually edit the schema definition files to perform the following actions:      * Add fields that mongodrdl did not discover within the subset of documents that it sampled  * Remove fields  * Remove tables  * Rename tables, so long as the collection field remains the same  * Rename fields using the sqlname option \nIMPORTANT To apply any changes you make to your DRDL files, you must restart mongosqld. \nNOTE BI Connector does not recognize geospatial fields when reading from a view.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nSAMPLING TYPE CONFLICTS \nOn this page    \n * Scalar-Scalar Conflicts\n   \n * Composite Conflicts Changed in version 2.6. The flexible schema model of MongoDB allows a given field to contain data of multiple types, while relational databases restrict columns to a single data type. The BI Connector samples data from MongoDB to generate a relational schema model, but type conversion conflicts may occur when the BI Connector samples different data types from a field in MongoDB documents. There are two main categories of type conversion conflicts that may occur in the presence of multiple data types: conflicts between scalar types and conflicts involving composite types like documents and arrays. \nNOTE The BI Connector only uses the sampled subset of your data to detect type conflicts during schema generation. If your data set contains type conflicts on a field and the conflicting types were not both present in the sample, the generated schema will not be prepared to resolve these conflicts and may result in increased query latency. For more information on sampling configuration, such as setting the --samplesize and --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs, see Schema Options. \nSCALAR-SCALAR CONFLICTS \nWhen a scalar-scalar confict occurs, the BI Connector uses the following lattice to determine the least upper bound of the two different data types:  \nEXAMPLE If a given field contains int, double, and string types, the least upper bound is string. When a scalar-scalar conflict occurs, the BI Connector inserts a row into the information_schema.COLUMNS table and lists the different sampled types in the COLUMN_COMMENT column. \nCOMPOSITE CONFLICTS \nComposite conflicts are type conversion conflicts involving a document or an array. The following sections describe how the BI Connector resolves both types of composite conflicts. \nDOCUMENT CONFLICTS \nWhen a conflict occurs involving a document, the BI Connector displays the fields of the document type as separate columns using dot notation. For example, the conflict collection contains the following documents: { _id: 0, a: \"foo\" } // \"a\" is scalar (string){ _id: 1, a: { a: \"bar\", b: \"baz\" } } // \"a\" is composite (document) The BI Connector detects a scalar-composite conflict and generates the following relational schema: Table: conflict _id\na\na.a\na.b\n0\n\"foo\"\nNULL\nNULL\n1\nNULL\n\"bar\"\n\"baz\" When a conflict occurs involving a document, the BI Connector inserts a row into the information_schema.COLUMNS table and lists the different sampled types in the COLUMN_COMMENT column. \nARRAY CONFLICTS \nWhen a conflict occurs involving an array, the BI Connector creates a new table for the conflict field with a column for the foreign key, array index, and value. The BI Connector unwinds the array into multiple rows in new table and fills in the columns accordingly. For example, the conflict collection contains the following documents: { _id: 0, a: \"foo\" } // \"a\" is scalar (string){ _id: 1, a: [\"bar\", \"baz\"] } // \"a\" is composite (array) The BI Connector renders the above into the following two tables: Table: conflict _id\n0\n1 Table: conflict_a _id\na_idx\na\n0\nNULL\n\"foo\"\n1\n0\n\"bar\"\n1\n1\n\"baz\" When a conflict occurs involving an array, the BI Connector:      * Inserts a row into the information_schema.COLUMNS table and lists any different types sampled in the COLUMN_COMMENT column  * Inserts a row into the information_schema.TABLES table containing information on how the array maps to the row in the information_schema.COLUMNS table ←  Geospatial DataSchema Management Changes in 2.11 → On this page  *

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nMONGOTRANSLATE \nOn this page    \n * Description\n   \n * Usage\n * Command Line Options\n * Examples \nDESCRIPTION \nmongotranslate is a learning tool designed to help users understand how SQL queries can be expressed in the MongoDB aggregation language. The BI Connector's SQL-to-aggregation translation engine provides the translations, which can also be used to troubleshoot specific BI Connector translation issues. mongotranslate is a standalone program. It requires a drdl file generated by mongodrdl, but does not require mongosqld or mongod to be running at the time of execution. \nUSAGE \nmongotranslate has the following syntax: mongotranslate [--query | --queryFile] <query | queryfile> [options]  \nCOMMAND LINE OPTIONS \n--query \nSpecifies a SQL query to translate into a MongoDB aggregation pipeline. Either --query or --queryFile is required. --queryFile \nSpecifies a path to a file containing a SQL query to translate into a MongoDB aggregation pipeline. Either --query or --queryFile is required. --schema \nRequired. Specifies a .drdl schema file or a directory containing one or more .drdl schema files created by the mongodrdl program to use when translating a SQL query into an aggregation pipeline. --dbName \nDefault: test The database name to use for unqualified table names in the SQL query. The following example uses a collection named fruit and the --dbName option to specify that fruit is in the groceries database: mongotranslate \"SELECT * FROM fruit WHERE _id > 100;\" \\  --schema schema.drdl --dbName groceries  If you do not use the --dbName option to specify a database, mongotranslate assumes that fruit is in the test database. If the schema does not contain a database named test, or a table name fruit in the test database, mongotranslate returns an error. The following example uses a fully-qualified table name, so it does not need the --dbName option. mongotranslate \"SELECT * FROM groceries.fruit WHERE _id > 100;\" \\  --schema schema.drdl  If you specify a database with each table name in your SQL query, the --dbName option is ignored if it is used. --explain \nOptional. Returns the explain output for the query plan instead of the translated aggregation pipeline. Using --explain returns similar output to running EXPLAIN <query> on a BI tool connected to BI Connector. --format \nDefault: multiline Optional. Valid options are none and multiline. The default multiline option displays results in a more easily readable format. Command Type\nOption\nDescription\nWithout the --explain option\n--format none\nReturns an aggregation pipeline all on one line.\nWithout the --explain option\n--format multiline\nReturns an aggregation pipeline with one pipeline stage per line.\nWith the --explain option\n--format none\nReturns all fields on one line.\nWith the --explain option\n--format multiline\nReturns one field per line, with additional formatting for arrays and object subfields. --mongoversion \nDefault: latest Optional.

If you must use double quotes or backticks in your query, use the --queryFile option. The following example specifies a query file and returns a one-line result: mongotranslate --queryFile=query.txt --schema=schema.drdl --format=none  The following example uses the --explain option:

Auto Mode\n * Deprecations The MongoDB Connector for BI version 2.11 release introduces significant improvements to stored schema management. The new stored-schema format is equivalent to DRDL files. These improvements are incompatible with BI Connector configurations from versions 2.10 and earlier. If you are running BI Connector 2.10 or earlier, use the following sections to update your configuration to be compatible with version 2.11 or later. If you are already running version 2.11 or later, no further configuration changes are required. To learn more about the different schema management configurations introduced in version 2.11, see the Sampling Mode Reference Chart. \nSTANDALONE READER CHANGES \nUse the following table to modify your BI Connector version 2.10 or earlier Standalone Reader configuration to be compatible with version 2.11 and later: Version 2.10 and Earlier\nVersion 2.11 and Later\nMode\nStandalone Reader\nStandalone Reader\nBehavior\nmongosqld samples data upon startup and holds the schema in memory.\nmongosqld samples data upon startup and holds the schema in memory.\nOptions\n     * --sampleMode read  * --sampleSource not used To learn more about version 2.10's schema options, see the 2.10 documentation. None. The --sampleMode option is deprecated in version 2.11. Remove this command line option or configuration file setting to continue using standalone mode. Any other standalone mode configurations that worked in earlier releases will continue to work with version 2.11 and later. Example The following example launches BI Connector versions 2.10 and earlier in Standalone Reader mode: mongosqld --sampleMode read  The following example launches BI Connector versions 2.11 and later in Standalone Reader mode: mongosqld  To learn more about sampling modes, see the Sampling Mode Reference Chart. \nCLUSTERED-READER MODE TO CUSTOM MODE \nUse the following table to modify your BI Connector version 2.10 or earlier Clustered-Reader configuration to be compatible with the version 2.11 and later: Version 2.10 and Earlier\nVersion 2.11 and Later\nMode\nClustered-Reader

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nJDBC AUTHENTICATION PLUGIN \nOn this page    \n * Prerequisites\n   \n * Installing the Plugin New in version 2.2. The MongoDB Connector for BI provides a client-side MySQL authentication plugin for Java that integrates with MySQL's Connector/J JDBC driver. The mongosql_auth plugin allows a client to authenticate with a BI Connector and MongoDB deployment running with authentication enabled using one of the following authentication mechanisms:      * SCRAM-SHA-1  * SCRAM-SHA-256  * PLAIN (LDAP)  * GSSAPI (Kerberos) \nNOTE  * The SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanisms hash the passwords in the client plugin; however, all other data is in cleartext. If possible, use with encrypted connections.  * The PLAIN mechanism sends the password in cleartext. Use encrypted connections with the PLAIN mechanism . \nPREREQUISITES \nThis plugin requires a version of MySQL Connector/J between 5.1.39 and the latest 5.1.x. It can't use MySQL Server or MySQL Connector/J 8.0 or later. \nINSTALLING THE PLUGIN \nTo download the plugin .jar file, choose one of the following options: \nDOWNLOAD FROM THE GITHUB REPOSITORY \n 1.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nKNOWN ISSUES FOR MONGODB CONNECTOR FOR BI \nOn this page    \n * SQL Compatibility Issues \nSQL COMPATIBILITY ISSUES  BI CONNECTOR RETURNS EMPTY SET WHERE MYSQL RETURNS NULL VALUES \nSome SQL aggregate functions (like SUM, MIN, or COUNT) return NULL if there are no matching values for that aggregate function. This response is effectively an empty row. Given the exact same SQL query, the BI Connector does not return NULL for any aggregate functions; it returns an empty set instead. \nEXAMPLE You are analyzing the test performance of students for each of the classes offered in the last year by a university. Using Tableau, you run a SQL query to find statistics for each class, including the highest and lowest test scores as well as the sum and count of all the scores in the class. SELECT SUM(scores), COUNT(*), COUNT(scores), MAX(scores), MIN(scores)FROM students_2019GROUP BY class;  Unfortunately, you accidentally run the query on the data for next year's classes, so there are no test scores for the query to find. If the student data was stored in MySQL, this query would return a single row with NULL values for fields that are calculated with the SUM, MAX, and MIN functions and 0 for fields that are calculated with the COUNT function. SELECT SUM(scores), COUNT(*), COUNT(scores), MAX(scores), MIN(scores)FROM students_2019GROUP BY class;\n+-------------+----------+---------------+-------------+-------------+| sum(scores) | count(*) | count(scores) | max(scores) | min(scores) |+-------------+----------+---------------+-------------+-------------+|   NULL      |        0 |             0 |   NULL      |   NULL      |+-------------+----------+---------------+-------------+-------------+  If the student data was stored in MongoDB and accessed via the BI Connector, this query would return an empty set.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nSYSTEM VARIABLES \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Setting System Variables \nOVERVIEW \nBI Connector provides the following environment variables: System Variable\nData Type\nDescription\nDefault Value\nfull_pushdown_exec_mode\nboolean\nSpecifies whether a query error is returned for queries with clauses that aren't fully translated to the MongoDB query language. SQL query predicates are used to filter data returned by the query.\n0 (false)\nlog_level\ninteger Specifies the logging level for BI Connector:      * -1: Do not log.  * 0: Log only messages for database users, such as basic mongosqld events and state changes.  * 1: Log messages for database users and mongosqld administrators.  * 2: For internal use only. 2 (Atlas-hosted) and 0 (self-managed)\nmax_nested_table_depth\ninteger\nSpecifies the maximum number of unique nested field paths that mongosqld maps to a relational table for a collection.\n50\nmax_num_global_tables\ninteger\nThe maximum number of tables allowed in a MongoDB deployment with an automatically- generated schema.\n4000\nmax_num_tables_per_collection\ninteger\nThe maximum number of tables allowed in a collection in a table with an automatically-generated schema.\n200\nmax_nested_table_depth\ninteger\nThe default limit for table's nesting depth of arrays that MongoDB translates to tables, in a collection with an automatically-generated schema.\n10\nmax_num_fields_per_collection\ninteger\nThe maximum number of fields examined per collection in a table with an automatically-generated schema.\n2000\nmongodb_max_varchar_length\ninteger\nSpecifies the maximum string length returned for columns using the VARCHAR data type. A value of 0 specifies no limit.\n0\npolymorphic_type_conversion_mode\nstring Determines how BI Connector evaluates document fields that are specified with multiple data types. For example, count could be a number in one document and a string in another. The data type that BI Connector selects depends on the value of the schema_mapping_mode system variable. A value of majority causes BI Connector to select the type that appears in the majority of document fields, while a value of lattice would cause BI Connector to select string as the data type for count. See Cached Sampling for more information. Set polymorphic_type_conversion_mode to one of the following values:  * off: Queries may fail if you do not explicitly cast document fields that are specified with multiple data types.  * fast: BI Connector converts only document fields that appeared as multiple data types during sampling.  * safe: BI Connector converts all document fields to the data type discovered during sampling, even if the fields do not appear as multiple data types. off\nreconcile_arithmetic_agg_functions\nboolean Allows you to choose the behavior where MongoDB does not automatically convert types for some queries using arithmetic aggregate functions. In MongoDB version 3.6 and earlier, this behavior results in improved performance, compared with implicit type conversions for arithmetic aggregation functions in subsequent versions. See Type Conversion Modes for more information. true\nsample_refresh_interval_secs\ninteger Specifies how frequently, in seconds, that the BI Connector schema is updated. A value of 0 specifies that the schema is not refreshed after BI Connector starts. See Cached Sampling for more information. 0\nsample_size\ninteger Specifies how many documents BI Connector samples when generating its schema. A value of 0 specifies that BI Connector performs a collection scan across all sample namespaces. See Cached Sampling for more information. 100\nschema_mapping_mode\nstring Specifies how the MongoDB schema is transformed into a relational schema:  * lattice: See Sampling Type Conflicts for more information.  * majority: BI Connector assigns the most common data type for a field occuring in a sample. lattice\ntype_conversion_mode\nstring Specifies the semantics that BI Connector uses for type conversions, such as the CAST function.  * mysql  * mongosql mongosql \nSETTING SYSTEM VARIABLES \nYou must have the atlasAdmin database role to set environment variables on an Atlas-hosted BI Connector.

Example \nDESCRIPTION  NOTE The MongoDB Connector for BI and associated utilities are compatible with all currently supported MongoDB server versions. mongodrdl is a relational schema management tool for the MongoDB Connector for BI. The mongodrdl binary can:      * Produce a schema based on the contents of one or more MongoDB collections and write them out into .drdl files used by mongosqld.  * Upload a .drdl file's schema to the MongoDB deployment your BI Connector is reading from.  * Download stored schemas from your MongoDB deployment.  * Delete stored schemas from your MongoDB deployment.  * Name stored schemas in your MongoDB deployment for easier management. You can edit a .drdl file manually to customize the BI Connector's schema. To learn more about the .drdl format and manually editing .drdl files, see Load a Schema from a DRDL File. To learn more about all BI Connector schema management options, see Map Relational Schemas to MongoDB. \nIMPORTANT To apply any changes you make to your DRDL files, you must restart mongosqld. \nSYNTAX \nmongodrdl uses the following syntax: mongodrdl [<command>] [<options...>]  \nDEFAULT MINIMUM TLS VERSION \nNew in version 2.6. The default minimum TLS version is 1.1 for outgoing connections from mongodrdl to MongoDB. You can adjust this setting with the --minimumTLSVersion option. \nCOMMANDS \nNew in version 2.11. The behavior of mongodrdl is determined by one of the following commands. If no command is specified, mongodrdl samples the specified namespace. sample \nSamples the namespaces specified by the --db, optional --collection, and other command line options to output a .drdl file. The sample command encapsulates all the mongodrdl behavior prior to version 2.11. mongodrdl sample --db <db-name> --collection <collection-name> --out <filename>.drdl \nlist-schema-ids \nLists the string representation of the ObjectId of each stored schema and the date it was created. list-schema-ids requires the following option: Name\nDescription\n--schemaSource\nRequired. Specifies the database where the schema information is stored.

For example, the following command names the 5d72adea5c23a9e44882a1ad schema in the schemas database as movies: mongodrdl name-schema --name movies --schemaSource schemas --schema 5d72adea5c23a9e44882a1ad  \nOPTIONS  CORE OPTIONS \n--help \nReturns information on the options and use of mongodrdl. --version \nReturns the mongodrdl release number. --verbose <level>, -v <level> \nSpecifies that mongodrdl should provide more detailed log output. Include multiple times for more verbosity (e.g. -vvvvv), or specify a numeric value (e.g. --verbose=5). --quiet \nHides all log output. --uri <mongodb-uri> \nNew in version 2.12. MongoDB URI connection string. \nIMPORTANT The following command-line options cannot be used in conjunction with --uri option:  * --host  * --port  * --db  * --username  * --password (if the URI connection string also includes the password)  * --authenticationDatabase  * --authenticationMechanism Instead, specify these options as part of your --uri connection string. --host <hostname><:port>, -h <hostname><:port> \nDefault: localhost:27017 Specifies a resolvable hostname for the mongod to which to connect. By default, the mongodrdl attempts to connect to a MongoDB instance running on the localhost on port number 27017. To connect to a replica set, specify the replSetName and a seed list of set members, as in the following: <replSetName>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2><:port>,<...>  You can always connect directly to a single MongoDB instance by specifying the host and port number directly. --port <port> \nDefault: 27017 Specifies the TCP port on which the MongoDB instance listens for client connections. --db

\nSpecifies a collection from which to generate a .drdl schema file. If you do not specify a collection, this option will use all collections in the specified database or instance. --customFilterField <name>, -f <name> \nSpecifies the field name to add for a custom MongoDB filter. See Custom Filters for more details. --out <path>, -o <path> \nDefault: Standard out. Specifies the path where mongodrdl will write the schema file. To send the schema to standard output, specify \"-\" instead of a path. --sampleSize <size>, -s <size> \nDefault: 1000 Specifies the number of documents to sample when generating the collection's schema. --uuidSubtype3Encoding <old|csharp|java>, -b <old|csharp|java> \nSpecify the encoding used to generate UUID binary subtype 3. Choose one of the following values:  * old: Old BSON binary subtype representation  * csharp: The C#/.NET legacy UUID representation  * java: The Java legacy UUID representation --preJoined \nGenerate unwound tables including parent columns, resulting in a \"pre-joined\" table. --schemaSource <db-name> \nNew in version 2.11. Specifies the database where the schema information is stored. This option is not used by the sample command. \nTLS/SSL OPTIONS \n--ssl \nDefault: False Instructs mongodrdl to use TLS/SSL when connecting to a MongoDB instance. --sslCAFile <filename> \nSpecifies the MongoDB instance's .pem file containing the root certificate chain from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the .pem file using relative or absolute paths. \nWARNING For SSL connections (--ssl) to mongod and mongos, if the mongodrdl runs without the --sslCAFile, mongodrdl will not attempt to validate the server certificates. This creates a vulnerability to expired mongod and mongos certificates as well as to foreign processes posing as valid mongod or mongos instances. Ensure that you always specify the CA file to validate the server certificates in cases where intrusion is a possibility. --sslPEMKeyFile <filename> \nSpecifies the .pem file containing both the TLS/SSL certificate and key for mongosqld to use when connecting to MongoDB. You can specify the file name of the .pem file using either using a relative or absolute path. This option is required when using the --ssl option to connect to a mongod or mongos that has CAFile enabled without allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates. --sslPEMKeyPassword <password> \nSpecifies the path to a file containing the certificate and private key for connecting to MongoDB. --sslCRLFile <filename> \nSpecifies the .pem file that contains the Certificate Revocation List. Specify the file name of the .pem file using relative or absolute paths. --sslAllowInvalidCertificates \nPermits the MongoDB instance to present an invalid server SSL/TLS certificate.

Value\nDescription\nSCRAM-SHA-1\nRFC 5802 standard Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism using the SHA1 hash function.\nSCRAM-SHA-256\nNew in version 2.6: RFC 7677 standard Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism using the SHA2 hash function.\nPLAIN (LDAP SASL)\nExternal authentication using LDAP. You can also use PLAIN for authenticating in-database users. PLAIN transmits passwords in plain text. This mechanism is available only in MongoDB Enterprise.\nGSSAPI (Kerberos)\nExternal authentication using Kerberos. This mechanism is available only in MongoDB Enterprise. --gssapiServiceName <service-name> \nDefault: mongodb Service name to use when authenticating using GSSAPI/Kerberos. --gssapiHostName <hostname> \nDefault: remote server's address Hostname to use when authenticating using GSSAPI/Kerberos. \nCUSTOM FILTERS \nBI Connector uses a MongoDB aggregation pipeline to perform queries against a MongoDB database. You can add a special field to your schema to pass a custom MongoDB $match query string to your MongoDB instance. Use the --customFilterField option with mongodrdl to name a custom filter field. This field passes a native MongoDB $match stage to use as the first stage of the aggregation pipeline, which filters any results returned from MongoDB. The BI Connector applies this stage before any additional stages pushed down from SQL. The query can refer to any field in the collection, even if the fields are not exposed in the relational schema. For an example of custom filter usage, see Custom Filter Example. \nUSAGE EXAMPLES  SCHEMA GENERATION EXAMPLE \nGiven documents of the following shape in the collection abc in the database test: {    \"_id\": ObjectId(),    \"close\": 7.45,    \"detail\": { \"a\": 2, \"b\": 3 }}  Run mongodrdl to generate a schema based on this collection: mongodrdl -d test -c abc -o schema.drdl  The generated schema file (schema.drdl) looks similar to the following: schema:- db: test  tables:  - table: abc    collection: abc    pipeline: []    columns:    - Name: _id      MongoType: bson.ObjectId      SqlName: _id      SqlType: varchar    - Name: close      MongoType: float64      SqlName: close      SqlType: numeric    - Name: detail.a      MongoType: float64      SqlName: detail.a      SqlType: numeric    - Name: detail.b      MongoType: float64      SqlName: detail.b      SqlType: numeric  \nCUSTOM FILTER EXAMPLE \nTo use this field, specify the --customFilterField flag with the name you want this field to have: mongodrdl [ other options ] --customFilterField _MONGOFILTER -o schema.drdl  Your DRDL file schema.drdl will include the following field in every generated table: - Name: _MONGOFILTER  MongoType: mongo.Filter  SqlName: _MONGOFILTER  SqlType: varchar  To add the special MongoDB query stage to your standard SQL, use the following SQL syntax: SELECT <normal>  FROM <tablename>  WHERE <normal conditions> AND      _MONGOFILTER='{ <json string that represents query to use> }'\nSELECT name,age  FROM users  WHERE active='t' AND      _MONGOFILTER='{\"addr\":{\"$elemMatch\":{\"city\":\"Springfield\",\"state\":\"CA\"}}}'  The BI Connector will translate the above SQL into the following MongoDB aggregation expression:

\nAUTHENTICATION EXAMPLE \nIf your MongoDB server is running with authentication enabled, you must specify a username, password, and authentication database as options to your mongodrdl command. To create a .drdl file from a mongod instance with authentication enabled, use the following command format: mongodrdl --host myhost.example.net:27017 \\          --username dbUser \\          --password myPassword \\          --db reports \\          --collection FY2017 \\          --authenticationDatabase admin \\          --out schema.drdl  \nMONGODB ATLAS EXAMPLE \nMongoDB Atlas is a cloud service for running, monitoring, and maintaining MongoDB deployments, including the provisioning of dedicated servers for MongoDB instances. \nNOTE MongoDB Atlas now offers a hosted BI Connector and does not require a .drdl file. For more information on the Atlas-hosted BI Connector, see Connect via BI Connector for Atlas. If you are running the BI Connector locally and wish to create a .drdl file from an Atlas database, use the following command format: mongodrdl --host <domain0>.mongodb.net:27017,<domain1>.mongodb.net:27017,... \\          --username <username> \\          --password <password> \\          --ssl \\          --authenticationDatabase admin \\

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nDOCUMENT RELATIONAL DEFINITION LANGUAGE \nOn this page    \n * File Format\n   \n * Field Types\n * Embedded Documents\n * Custom Filters\n * Aggregation Pipelines Document Relational Definition Language (DRDL) defines a relational view of a MongoDB schema. mongodrdl samples documents from your MongoDB collections and derives a DRDL file from those documents. mongosqld then uses the schema defined in DRDL files to allow MySQL clients to query your MongoDB data. \nFILE FORMAT \nThe DRDL file lists your databases, tables, and columns in YAML format. schema:- db: <database name>  tables:  - table: <SQL table name>    collection: <MongoDB collection name>    pipeline:    - <optional pipeline elements>    columns:    - Name: <MongoDB field name>      MongoType: <MongoDB field type>      SqlName: <mapped SQL column name>      SqlType: <mapped SQL column type> \nEXAMPLE \nGiven documents of the following shape in the collection abc in the database test: {    \"_id\": ObjectId(),    \"close\": 7.45,    \"detail\": { \"a\": 2, \"b\": 3 }}  Run mongodrdl to generate a schema based on this collection: mongodrdl -d test -c abc -o schema.drdl  The generated schema file (schema.drdl) looks similar to the following: schema:- db: test  tables:  - table: abc    collection: abc    pipeline: []    columns:    - Name: _id      MongoType: bson.ObjectId      SqlName: _id      SqlType: varchar    - Name: close      MongoType: float64      SqlName: close      SqlType: numeric    - Name: detail.a      MongoType: float64      SqlName: detail.a      SqlType: numeric    - Name: detail.b      MongoType: float64      SqlName: detail.b      SqlType: numeric  \nFIELD TYPES \nBI Connector maps fields that always contain the same data type into the relational model. Schema generation deals specially with the following cases: Numeric BI Connector uses the most precise numeric type that matches the sampled documents. If a field in a collection always has the same data type, BI Connector uses that type. If a field in a collection can contain either floating point values or integers, BI Connector uses type numeric. Dates\nBI Connector treats any field of type data_date as the SQL timestamp type.\nTimestamps\nBI Connector ignores any field of type data_timestamp.\nObjectID\nBI Connector treats any field of type data_oid as the SQL type varchar.\nUUID\nBI Connector treats any field of type UUID as the SQL type varchar.\nGeospatial If a collection contains a geospatial index, BI Connector maps the indexed field into an array of numeric longitude-latitude coordinates. See Geospatial Data for an example. \nNOTE BI Connector does not recognize geospatial fields when reading from a view. Heterogeneous Fields If a field contains inconsistent types, BI Connector chooses the most frequently sampled type. If a field can contain either a type or an array of that type, the generated schema always specifies that the field contains an array. \nTIP \nSEE ALSO: How do I skip data incompatible with my DRDL type definition? \nEMBEDDED DOCUMENTS \nBI Connector maps embedded documents to simple fields that have a . separator character, making them appear similar to the way you would reference them using dot notation in a MongoDB query. While Tableau properly quotes identifiers, within ad-hoc SQL expressions you must double-quote every identifier that contains . characters or mixed-case characters. \nEXAMPLE \nConsider the following

 Running mongodrdl on a collection containing this document results in the following fields in the generated schema: _id\nnumeric\nfamilyName\nvarchar\nhometown\nvarchar\naddress.street\nvarchar\naddress.city\nvarchar\naddress.state\nvarchar\naddress.zip\nvarchar\nmembers_since\ntimestamp \nARRAYS \nBI Connector exposes arrays to business intelligence tools using two collections: one without the array, and the other having one document per array element. \nEXAMPLE \nIf you run mongodrdl on a collection named families which contains the following document: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"familyName\": \"Partridge\",   \"hometown\" : \"Hollywood Hills\",   \"familyMembers\" : [     {         \"firstname\" : \"Shirley\",         \"age\" : 42,         \"attributes\" : [             { \"name\" : \"instrument\", \"value\" : \"singer\" },             { \"name\" : \"role\", \"value\" : \"mom\" }         ]

          { \"name\" : \"role\", \"value\" : \"sister\" }         ]     }]}  This results in the following three tables: families\n_id\nnumeric\nfamilyName\nvarchar\nhometown\nvarchar

families_familyMembers_attributes\n_id\nnumeric\nfamilyMembers.attributes.name\nvarchar\nfamilyMembers.attributes.value\nvarchar\nfamilyMembers.attributes_idx\nnumeric\nfamilyMembers_idx\nnumeric You can join these tables together to view the data in a denormalized format. For example, you can list the people named in the above schema together with their family information using the following query: SELECT f.*, m.`familyMembers.firstname`FROM families_familyMembers mJOIN families fON m._id = f._id;  \nPRE-JOINING \nIf you provide the --preJoined option to mongodrdl, BI Connector adds the fields in the containing document to each array element's document, thus \"pre-joining\" the table. In the previous example, the tables would contain the following additional columns: families_familyMembers\nfamilyName\nvarchar\nhometown\nvarchar families_familyMembers_attributes\nfamilyMembers.age\nnumeric\nfamilyMembers.firstname\nvarchar\nfamilyMembers_idx\nnumeric\nfamilyName\nvarchar\nhometown\nvarchar \nCUSTOM FILTERS \nYou can add a column of type mongo.Filter to a collection in your DRDL file. This column type allows you to perform a custom $match query.

You can select only three-dimensional points using the following query: SELECT x, y, zFROM pointsWHERE filter='{\"z\": {\"$exists\": true}}';  \nAGGREGATION PIPELINES  AGGREGATION PIPELINES USING VIEWS \nMongoDB 3.4 introduces Read-Only Views that you can use to filter incompatible data. For example, you can create a view in the test database that contains only documents containing a number in the grade field of a grades collection: db.runCommand( { create: \"numericGrades\", viewOn: \"grades\", pipeline: [ { \"$match\": { \"grade\": { \"$type\": \"number\" } } } ] } )  You can then use mongodrdl to generate a schema from this view as you would a collection: mongodrdl -d test -c numericGrades  \nAGGREGATION PIPELINES IN DRDL \nBI Connector can use aggregation pipelines as part of the schema to transform documents from the collection into the proper form for the relational tables. For example, consider a simple document in a collection named simpleFamilies: {   \"_id\": 1,   \"familyName\": \"Partridge\",   \"familyMembers\" : [ \"Shirley\", \"Keith\", \"Laurie\"]}  mongodrdl generates a schema with the tables simpleFamilies and simpleFamilies_familyMembers. The table simpleFamilies_familyMembers enumerates each family member and has the following pipeline: pipeline:- $unwind:    includeArrayIndex: familyMembers_idx    path: $familyMembers This pipeline uses $unwind to create a new record for each member of familyMembers. The schema tracks the array index in the field familyMembers_idx. GEOSPATIAL DATA \nIf a collection contains a 2d or 2dsphere geospatial index, BI Connector maps the indexed field into an array of numeric longitude-latitude coordinates. EXAMPLE \nGiven the following collection: db.points.createIndex( { pos : \"2dsphere\" } )db.points.insertOne({    pos : { type: \"Point\", coordinates: [ -73.97, 40.77 ] },    name: \"Central Park\",    category : \"Parks\"})  BI Connector generates the following schema: schema:- db: test  tables:  - table: points    collection: points    pipeline: []    columns:    - Name: _id      MongoType:

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nMONGODB BI CONNECTOR ODBC DRIVER \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Compatibility\n * Supported Platforms\n * Using the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver \nOVERVIEW \nThe MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver provides connectivity between a SQL client and the MongoDB Connector for BI. The MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver enables users to create a Data Source Name (DSN) and connect a variety of BI tools to the BI Connector. It includes the BI Connector authentication plugin, which implements the client side of MongoDB-supported authentication mechanisms. \nNOTE The MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver connects the DSN to the BI Connector.  \nCOMPATIBILITY \nThe MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver is compatible with BI Connector version 2.5 and later. The latest production version of BI Connector is available from the MongoDB Download Center. \nSUPPORTED PLATFORMS \nThe MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver is available for:      * Windows (32-bit and 64-bit)\n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   Before installing the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver for Windows, ensure that the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 is installed on your system.  * macOS\n   \n   \n   IMPORTANT\n   \n   The 1.0.16 edition of ODBC Manager included with the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver is not compatible with macOS Catalina. If you are on Catalina, download and install the latest version (1.0.19) of ODBC manager.  * Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04  * RHEL 7 \nUSING THE MONGODB BI CONNECTOR ODBC DRIVER \nConfigure your system to use the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver by setting up a DSN. A DSN holds configuration information about your BI Connector instance, including server address, port number, and login credentials.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nLOG MESSAGES \nOn this page    \n * Timestamp\n   \n * Severity Levels\n * Components\n * Configure Log Verbosity Level\n * Log Filename Format mongosqld log messages have the form: <timestamp> <severity> <component> [<context>] <message> For example: 2017-08-17T13:34:48.910-0700 I NETWORK [initandlisten] waiting for connections at 127.0.0.1:3307 \nTIMESTAMP \nLog messages use iso8601 format for the timestamp, with a UTC offset set by the server on which mongosqld is running. \nSEVERITY LEVELS \nThe following table lists the severity levels associated with each log message: Level\nDescription\nF\nFatal\nE\nError\nW\nWarning\nI\nInformational, for Verbosity Level of 0\nD\nDebug, for All Verbosity Levels > 0 The default log verbosity level is 0, which includes all non-Debug messages. Increasing the verbosity level adds additional Debug messages to the logs. To set the verbosity level, see Configure Log Verbosity Levels. \nCOMPONENTS \nLog messages include a component field, providing functional categorization of the messages: Level\nDescription\nCONTROL Messages related to control activities, such as initialization.\nNETWORK Messages related to network activities, such as accepting connections.\nALGEBRIZER Messages related to query plan generation.\nOPTIMIZER Messages related to query plan optimization.\nEXECUTOR Messages related to query execution. \nCONFIGURE LOG VERBOSITY LEVEL \nTo configure the log verbosity level:      * Include the -v option when starting mongosqld from the command line, or  * Specify systemLog.verbosity in a mongosqld configuration file. To specify a verbosity level when starting mongosqld, use the -v option. Repeating v increases the verbosity level. \nEXAMPLE The following invocation of mongosqld sets the log verbosity level to Developer. mongosqld --schema schema.drdl --auth -vv  To learn more about the verbosity levels and how to use them, see --verbose. \nLOG FILENAME FORMAT \nNew in version 2.5. If you direct mongosqld to rotate log files with the --logRotate option, BI Connector adds a sequence number to ensure the uniqueness of each new log file name. Log files have the following format: <filename>.<logSeqNumber>.<timeStamp> For example: mongosqld.log.000000.2018-04-20T15_10_23.898858222-07_00 For more information on log file rotation, see the --logRotate option. ←  Document Relational Definition LanguageType Conversion Modes → On this page  * Timestamp\n * Severity Levels\n * Components\n * Configure Log Verbosity Level\n * Log Filename

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nC AUTHENTICATION PLUGIN \nOn this page    \n * Supported Platforms\n   \n * Installing the Plugin\n * Using the Plugin for Authentication The MongoDB authentication plugin is embedded in the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver. If your BI tool connects using the MongoDB BI Connector ODBC Driver through a DSN or the driver directly, you do not need to install the authentication plugin separately. Install the standalone authentication plugin if your BI tool does not use an ODBC driver and accepts authentication plugins, such the MySQL shell. The mongosql_auth plugin allows a client to authenticate with a BI Connector and MongoDB deployment running with authentication enabled using one of the following authentication mechanisms:      * SCRAM-SHA-1  * SCRAM-SHA-256  * PLAIN (LDAP)  * GSSAPI (Kerberos) \nNOTE  * The SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanisms hash the passwords in the client plugin; however, all other data is in cleartext. If possible, use with encrypted connections.  * The PLAIN mechanism sends the password in cleartext. Use encrypted connections with the PLAIN mechanism . \nSUPPORTED PLATFORMS \nThe plugin is built and tested on the following platforms:  * Windows 2008 R2 (32- and 64-bit)  * macOS 10.12 (64-bit)  * Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit)  * RHEL 7.0 (64-bit) \nIMPORTANT \nTESTING ENVIRONMENT The C Authentication plugin was developed against MySQL 5.7.X Community Edition (64-bit), and tested with MySQL 5.7.X Community Edition and the latest version of MongoDB Connector for BI. The plugin is not compatible with MySQL Server or Connector/ODBC driver version 8 and later. \nINSTALLING THE PLUGIN   \nUSING THE PLUGIN FOR AUTHENTICATION \nBefore you use the authentication plugin, you must set up authenticated users for MongoDB. For more information on creating authenticated users, see Enable Authentication. If you are using the Atlas-hosted BI Connector, see Configure Database Users. The procedure for using the C Authentication plugin library varies depending on your SQL client. The C Authentication plugin can be used via one of the following methods:  * DSN (Data Source Name) using the MySQL Connector/ODBC driver.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nTYPE CONVERSION MODES \nOn this page    \n * Mode Comparison Table New in version 2.6. The MongoDB Connector for BI attempts to convert SQL queries into MongoDB aggregation pipelines. When the BI Connector cannot translate a query into an aggregation pipeline, it executes the query in memory resulting in increased latency. Prior to version 2.6, mongosqld could not translate type conversions to aggregation expressions, which prevented the translation of any query relying on type conversions. Starting in version 2.6, the mongosql type conversion mode pushes all type conversions down to MongoDB servers running version 4.0 or later for improved expression performance. This mode is enabled by default but you can configure it on a per-session basis by setting the type_conversion_mode session variable to one of the following values: Mode\nDescription\nmongosql\nDefault. Pushes all type conversions down to MongoDB servers running version 4.0 or later. For MongoDB versions prior to 4.0, the BI Connector performs type conversions in memory.\nmysql\nInstructs the BI Connector to match MySQL's type conversion semantics as closely as possible. If the BI Connector can reproduce MySQL's type casting behavior in the aggregation language, it will push the expression down to the MongoDB server for execution. Otherwise, mongosqld executes the expression in memory. The following example sets the type_conversion_mode variable to mysql: SET SESSION type_conversion_mode = 'mysql';  \nIMPORTANT mongosql is the recommended type casting mode unless you require close replication of MySQL's behavior. The example above sets the mysql type conversion mode because mongosql is the default and does not need to be explicitly set. The type conversion mode applies to both:      * Explicit type conversions. For example:\n   \n   CAST(\"123\" AS unsigned)  * Implicit type conversions. For example, \"123\" + 456 \nMODE COMPARISON TABLE \nThe following table provides an overview of how MySQL's type conversion behavior differs from the BI Connector's default type conversion behavior (mongosql mode): From Type\nTo Type\nMySQL Behavior\nmongosql-mode Behavior\nVarchar\nNumeric\nParse the number from a string in a variety of different formats.

Docs Home → MongoDB Connector for BI \nUSER AUTHORIZATION MODEL \nNew in version 2.5. The MongoDB Connector for BI restricts which database administration, data definition, and data manipulation statements authenticated users can run. The following table maps a SQL statement and corresponding MySQL privilege to the required MongoDB privilege action: MySQL Statement\nMySQL Privilege\nMongoDB Privilege\nFLUSH LOGS\nRELOAD\nOnly available to the BI Connector's admin user specified by the --mongo-username option or the mongodb.net.auth.username setting.\nFLUSH SAMPLE\nNot in MySQL Depends on your sampling configuration: Standalone Reader:      * find for all sampled namespaces  * insert and update for all databases in the cluster Clustered Reader: The statement is not permitted in this mode. Clustered Writer:  * find for all sampled namespaces  * insert and update on the schema database specified by --schemaSource KILL  * PROCESS privilege to view all threads  * SUPER privilege to kill all threads and statements  * No privilege required to view and kill your own threads and statements  * killop to kill other user's connections or queries  * No privilege required to kill your own connection or query ALTER TABLE ALTER, CREATE, and INSERT privileges for the table. Renaming a table requires ALTER and DROP on the old table, as well as ALTER, CREATE, and INSERT on the new table. Depends on your sampling configuration: Standalone Reader: insert and update for all databases in the cluster. Clustered Reader: Not permitted in this mode. Clustered Writer: insert and update on the schema database specified by --schemaSource. SET (Variables) SUPER privilege is required to set global variables. Setting a session variable generally does not require any privilege, although there are exceptions that require the SUPER privilege (such as sql_log_bin). Either the BI Connector's admin user, as specified by the --mongo-username option or the mongodb.net.auth.username setting, or any MongoDB user with the inprog privilege can set global variables.

currently supported MongoDB server versions. mongosqld accepts incoming requests from a SQL client and proxies those requests to a mongod or mongos instance. \nUSAGE \nNew in version 2.3: You can start mongosqld either with a schema file in .drdl format using the --schema option or by sampling data from a MongoDB instance to create the schema. You can specify which namespace or namespaces to sample data from with the --sampleNamespaces option. If you don't specify any namespaces or a schema file, mongosqld samples data from all databases in the target MongoDB instance except the admin and local databases. You can specify a database in which to store schema information with the --schemaSource option. Otherwise, mongosqld holds the schema in memory. \nSTARTING MONGOSQLD WITH A SCHEMA FILE \nUse the --schema option to specify a schema file when starting mongosqld. mongosqld --schema /path/to/schema-file.drdl  Use mongodrdl to create a schema file from a MongoDB instance. \nSTARTING MONGOSQLD WITH A SCHEMA DATABASE \nUse the --schemaSource option to specify a database to store schema information. mongosqld --schemaSource sampleDb  \nSTARTING MONGOSQLD WITH SPECIFIED NAMESPACES \nUse the --sampleNamespaces option to specify databases and collections for mongosqld to sample data from to create the schema. mongosqld --sampleNamespaces contacts.addresses  See additional usage examples below. \nMONGODB USER PERMISSIONS \nIf your MongoDB instance uses authentication, your BI Connector instance must also use authentication. The user that connects to MongoDB via the mongosqld program must have permission to read from all the namespaces you wish to sample data from. For more details about MongoDB user permissions in BI Connector, see User Permissions for Cached Sampling. For more information on MongoDB users and roles, see Role-Based Access Control. See the example below of mongosqld with authentication. \nDEFAULT MINIMUM TLS VERSION \nNew in version 2.6. The default minimum TLS version is 1.1 for all client connections. This includes incoming client connections to mongosqld and outgoing connections to MongoDB. You can adjust this setting for incoming connections with the --minimumTLSVersion option and for outgoing connections with the --mongo-minimumTLSVersion option. \nCOMMAND LINE OPTIONS  CORE OPTIONS \n--help \nReturns information on the options and use of mongosqld. --addr \nDefault: 127.0.0.1:3307 Specifies the host address to listen on. --version \nReturns the mongosqld release number. --config

     * readPreference  * readPreferenceTags  * replicaSet  * connect For more information on these URI options see Read Preference Options and Replica Set Option. For options set in the Mongo URI not included in the list above, use the equivalent mongosqld option. For the complete list of mongosqld options, see Command Line Options. \nNOTE Instead of specifying a username and password in your connection string, run mongosqld with the --auth option to direct mongosqld to pass the authentication credentials provided by the SQL client to the MongoDB server. Similarly, instead of enabling ssl in the connection string, run mongosqld with --mongo-ssl. To disable automatic replica set server discovery logic and force a connection to the specified server, use the connect=direct option. mongosqld --mongo-uri \"mongodb://<hostname>:<port>/?connect=direct\"  URI options not in the list above nor in the list of supported mongosqld options are not supported. --mongo-versionCompatibility <version-number> \nRestricts mongosqld to using features that the specified version of MongoDB supports. Only necessary when used with replica sets in which members use different MongoDB versions or when performing a rolling upgrade of MongoDB. Only supports MongoDB version 3.2 or later. For example, if your replica set contains members running MongoDB 3.2 and other members running MongoDB 3.4, set the following option to restrict mongosqld to only use features supported by MongoDB 3.2: mongosqld --mongo-versionCompatibility 3.2 \n--maxVarcharLength <length> \nNew in version 2.2. Specifies the maximum length, in characters, for all varchar fields. If mongosqld encounters a string that is longer than the maximum length, mongosqld truncates it to the maximum length and logs a warning. --mongo-username <username>, -u <username> \nNew in version 2.3. Specifies the authentication username to use for schema discovery. Only required if --auth is enabled. The user specified by --mongo-username must be a valid MongoDB user with the listDatabases privilege. See mongosqld User Permissions. --mongo-password <password>, -p <password> \nNew in version 2.3. Specifies the authentication password to use for schema discovery. Only required if --auth is enabled. Use in conjunction with --mongo-username. --mongo-authenticationSource <auth-db-name> \nDefault: admin New in version 2.3.

Value\n--schemaMode Behavior\ncustom\nmongosqld reads a stored schema from the MongoDB database specified by the --schemaSource option.\nauto\nmongosqld samples the schema and writes the schema data to the MongoDB database specified by the --schemaSource option. For more information on configuring the sample mode, see the Sampling Mode Reference Chart. \nIMPORTANT If mongosqld has authentication enabled, the authenticated user must have the write privilege on the specified --schemaSource database. See Built-In Roles for more information about the readWrite role. --schemaSource <db-name> \nNew in version 2.11. Required whenever the --schemaMode is set. Specifies the database where the schema information is stored. \nNOTE If you do not specify any of the --schema, --schemaMode, and --schemaSource options, mongosqld holds its schema in memory. To learn more about sampling modes, see the Sampling Mode Reference Chart. --schemaName <db-name> \nDefault: defaultSchema New in version 2.11. Optional. The name of the schema to load from or write to the --schemaSource database. Specifying schema names allows you to store multiple schemas in the --schemaSource database. The behavior depends on on the value of --schemaMode: --schemaMode Value\n--schemaName Behavior\ncustom\nThe name of the schema to load from the database specified by the --schemaSource option.\nauto\nThe name of the schema to write to the --schemaSource database after the BI Connector samples the schema on startup. If not specified, defaults to defaultSchema. To learn more about sampling modes, see the Sampling Mode Reference Chart. --sampleSize <number> \nDefault: 1000 New in version 2.3. The number of documents per namespace to sample when gathering schema information. Set --sampleSize to 0 to include all documents in the specified namespace when building the schema. If you do not specify a namespace, setting --sampleSize to 0 causes mongosqld to consider all documents in all databases (excluding local, admin, and system) when building the schema. See an example below. --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs <number> \nDefault: 0 Changed in version 2.11: Renamed --sampleRefreshIntervalSecs to --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs The interval in seconds at which mongosqld re-samples data to create its schema. The default value is 0, which means that after the initial sampling no re-sampling occurs for the duration of the connection. The specified value must be a positive integer. To force a one-time update of the schema, use the FLUSH SAMPLE command from your SQL client. --uuidSubtype3Encoding <old|csharp|java>, -b <old|csharp|java> \nSpecify the encoding used to generate UUID binary subtype 3. Choose one of the following values:  * old: Old BSON binary subtype representation  * csharp: The C#/.NET legacy UUID representation  * java: The Java legacy UUID representation --prejoin \nNew in version 2.6. Schema option for combining array and non-array data into a single table. MongoDB documents which contain arrays are normally translated into tabular format with separate tables for array data and non-array data. Consider a MongoDB collection named test with the following document: { \"_id\" : 1, \"a\" : 3, \"b\" : [ \"orange\", \"apple\", \"pear\" ] } The above collection translates to the following two tables in tabular format: mysql> select * from test;+------+------+| _id  | a    |+------+------+|    1 |    3 |+------+------+\nmysql> select * from test_b;+------+--------+-------+| _id  | b      | b_idx |+------+--------+-------+|    1 | orange |     0 ||    1 | apple  |     1 ||    1 | pear   |     2 |+------+--------+-------+ The --prejoin flag causes data from the a column to be included in

You can specify the file name of the .pem file using either using a relative or absolute path. This option is required when using the --mongo-ssl option to connect to a mongod or mongos that has CAFile enabled without allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates. --mongo-sslPEMKeyPassword <password> \nSpecifies the path to a file containing the certificate and private key for connecting to MongoDB. --mongo-sslAllowInvalidHostnames \nPermits mongosqld to connect to a MongoDB server whose hostname differs from the hostname on its TLS/SSL certificate. --mongo-sslAllowInvalidCertificates \nPermits the MongoDB instance to present an invalid server SSL/TLS certificate. When using the allowInvalidCertificates setting, MongoDB logs the use of the invalid certificate as a warning. --mongo-sslCAFile <filename> \nSpecifies the MongoDB instance's .pem file containing the root certificate chain from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the .pem file using relative or absolute paths. \nWARNING For SSL connections (--mongo-ssl) to mongod and mongos, if the mongosqld runs without the --mongo-sslCAFile, mongosqld will not attempt to validate the server certificates. This creates a vulnerability to expired mongod and mongos certificates as well as to foreign processes posing as valid mongod or mongos instances. Ensure that you always specify the CA file to validate the server certificates in cases where intrusion is a possibility. --mongo-sslCRLFile <filename> \nSpecifies the MongoDB instance's .pem file containing the certificate revocation list. --mongo-sslFIPSMode \nEnables FIPS mode in the installed OpenSSL library. --mongo-minimumTLSVersion <TLS1_0|TLS1_1|TLS1_2> \nDefault: TLS1_1 Specifies the minimum required TLS version for outgoing connections to a mongod or mongos. instance. The default value TLS1_1 corresponds to TLS version 1.1. \nCLIENT TLS/SSL OPTIONS \n--sslMode <mode> \nDefault: disabled New in version 2.3. Enable or disable TLS/SSL for connections to mongosqld.

--sslPEMKeyFile <filename> \nSpecifies the .pem file containing both the TLS/SSL certificate and key for MySQL clients. Specify the file name of the .pem file using relative or absolute paths. --sslPEMKeyPassword <password> \nSpecifies the password used to decrypt the private key specified by --sslPEMKeyFile. --sslAllowInvalidCertificates \nPermits MySQL clients to present invalid client TLS/SSL certificates. --sslAllowInvalidHostnames \nPermits SQL clients to connect to a mongosqld whose hostname differs from the hostname on its TLS/SSL certificate. --sslCAFile <filename> \nSpecifies the mongosqld .pem file containing the root certificate chain from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the .pem file using relative or absolute paths. --sslCRLFile <filename> \nSpecifies the mongosqld .pem file containing the certificate revocation list. --auth \nRequires authentication for incoming client requests. \nIMPORTANT Changed in version 2.4.0. When authentication is enabled, admin credentials must be provided with the --mongo-username and --mongo-password options or the mongodb.net.auth.username and mongodb.net.auth.password settings in the configuration file. mongosqld uses the admin credentials to gather metadata on the sampled namespaces and uses the credentials of the connecting client to restrict data to only what the client is authorized to read. For more information on the required permissions for the admin user, see User Permissions for Cached Sampling. --defaultAuthSource <authSource> \nDefault: admin Specifies the default MongoDB authentication source. Set this value to specify a default source that mongosqld uses when authenticating with a MongoDB database. The authentication mechanisms GSSAPI and PLAIN use the $external source, while SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 use a MongoDB database as its source. If no value is given for this option it defaults to the the MongoDB admin database. The $external authentication source stores a reference to system users in a MongoDB database called $external, but the credentials are stored in an external, non-MongoDB system, such as an LDAP server. Any connection which uses the default value can omit the source parameter from its MySQL or Tableau username. --defaultAuthMechanism <authMechanism> \nDefault: SCRAM-SHA-1 Specifies the default authentication mechanism.

\nDefault: mongodb New in version 2.5. Set the Kerberos SPN when connecting to Kerberized MongoDB instances. This value must match the service name set on MongoDB instances. --gssapiConstrainedDelegation \nDefault: False New in version 2.11. Use proxy credentials for Kerberos authorization, enabling constrained delegation. Requires mongosqld service credentials to be present in the client keytab as well as the service keytab. See Configure Kerberos for BI Connector for more information about Kerberos configuration. \nSOCKET OPTIONS \n--filePermissions <mode> \nDefault: 448 Specify the permissions for the Unix domain socket file. --noUnixSocket \nDisable listening on Unix domain sockets. --unixSocketPrefix <path> \nDefault: /tmp Specifies an alternative directory for the mongosqld Unix domain socket. mongosqld will create a socket file called mysql.sock underneath this path. If you do not specify --unixSocketPrefix, the socket will exist at /tmp/mysql.sock. \nSET PARAMETER OPTION \n--setParameter <parameter> Parameter\nType\nCorresponds to\n\"polymorphic_type_conversion_mode=<value>\"\nstring Determines how mongosqld evaluates document fields that are specified with multiple data types. Accepted values are off, fast, and safe. To learn more about these values, see System Variables. \"type_conversion_mode=<value>\"\nstring Specifies which mode mongosqld uses to convert data types. BI Connector uses its own mode (mongosql) by default. Accepted values are mongosql and mysql. To learn more about these values, see System Variables. The following example starts mongosqld and uses the --setParameter option to specify the type conversion mode: mongosqld --setParameter \"type_conversion_mode=mongosql\"  \nCONFIGURATION FILE \nYou may configure mongosqld using a YAML configuration file. This file may contain the settings listed in the following sections. \nNOTE You may use expansion directives in your configuration file to load externally sourced configuration values. Expansion directives obscure confidential information like security certificates and passwords.

Check your local system documentation to determine the correct paths for your system. systemLog:  logAppend: false  path: \"/var/log/mongosqld/mongosqld.log\"  verbosity: 2\nsecurity:  enabled: true\nmongodb:  net:    uri: \"mongo.example.com:27017\"    auth:      username: \"root\"      password: \"changeme\"\nnet:  bindIp: 192.0.2.14  port: 3307  ssl:    mode: \"allowSSL\"    PEMKeyFile: \"/vagrant/certificates/mongosqld-server.pem\"    CAFile: \"/vagrant/certificates/ca.crt\"\nschema:  sample:    namespaces: \"inventory.*\"\nprocessManagement:  service:    name: mongosqld    displayName: mongosqld    description: \"BI Connector SQL proxy server\"  \nUSAGE EXAMPLES  MONGOSQLD WITH A SCHEMA FILE \nUse the --schema option to specify a schema file for mongosqld to use. mongosqld --schema /path/to/schema-file.drdl  \nSPECIFY A COLLECTION TO SAMPLE \nUse the --sampleNamespaces option to specify a database and collection for mongosqld to sample data from. If you start mongosqld without the --sampleNamespaces option, it samples data from all available databases except the admin and local databases. The following example samples data from a collection named addresses in a database named contacts: mongosqld --sampleNamespaces contacts.addresses  \nSPECIFY MULTIPLE COLLECTIONS TO SAMPLE \nTo sample data from all the collections in a database, use the --sampleNamespaces option with a wildcard (*).

The following example samples data from all the collections in databases named cars and boats: mongosqld --sampleNamespaces 'cars.*' \\          --sampleNamespaces 'boats.*' \\  You can mix and match wildcards and specific collections with multiple --sampleNamespaces options. The following example samples data from all collections in a database named orders, as well as the FY2015 and FY2016 collections from the expenses database: mongosqld --sampleNamespaces 'orders.*' \\          --sampleNamespaces expenses.FY2015 \\          --sampleNamespaces expenses.FY2016 \\  \nNOTE It is only necessary to enclose the namespace in single quotes when you use a wildcard. \nEXCLUDE DATABASES AND COLLECTIONS FROM SAMPLING \nTo exclude specified namespaces from the data sampling process, precede the namespace with a ~ (tilde) character. The following example includes all databases and collections except the apples collection in the fruit database: mongosqld --sampleNamespaces ~fruit.apples  Use the * wildcard character to indicate all collections in a database. The following example excludes the entire vehicles database from data sampling: mongosqld --sampleNamespaces '~vehicles.*'  \nSAMPLE ALL DOCUMENTS IN A COLLECTION \nIf you have a collection in which some documents have different fields from others and you want to ensure that the schema takes them all into consideration, set the --sampleSize option to 0. This causes mongosqld to examine all documents in the specified namespace when it builds its schema. The following example instructs mongosqld to build the schema based on all documents in the inventory.electronics namespace. mongosqld --sampleNamespaces inventory.electronics \\          --sampleSize 0  \nSPECIFY A DATABASE TO PERSIST A SCHEMA \nUse the --schemaSource option to specify a database in which to store schema information. Use the --schemaMode option to specify whether mongosqld can write to the schema database or only read from it. The following example command uses a database named sampleDb to store schema information and sets --schemaMode to auto. mongosqld --schemaSource sampleDb --schemaMode auto  \nIMPORTANT If mongosqld has authentication enabled, the authenticated user must have the write privilege on the specified --schemaSource database. See Built-In Roles for more information about the readWrite role. \nSPECIFY A DATA RESAMPLING INTERVAL \nUse the --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs option to specify an interval in seconds for mongosqld to resample data and regenerate the schema. The default value for this option is 0, which means that mongosqld never resamples data. If you set a resampling interval with --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs and you specify a schema database with --schemaSource, you cannot set --schemaMode to custom. The following example does not specify a schema database or a schema file, so it holds its schema in memory. It uses --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs to specify a data resampling interval of 3600 seconds. mongosqld --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs 3600  \nMONGOSQLD WITH AUTHENTICATION ENABLED \nTo connect mongosqld to a MongoDB instance running with authentication enabled, use the --auth option and provide MongoDB user credentials. The following example starts mongosqld with credentials for a user named reportsUser with password reportsPass, who has access to the reports.inventory namespace. mongosqld --auth \\          --mongo-username reportsUser \\          --mongo-password reportsPass \\          --sampleNamespaces reports.inventory  This example does not specify an authenticating database with the --mongo-authenticationSource option, so it defaults to admin. It does not specify an authentication mechanism with the --mongo-authenticationMechanism option, so it defaults to SCRAM-SHA-1. \nMONGOSQLD WITH A CONFIGURATION FILE \nIf you wish to specify a configuration file which saves logs to /var/log/mongosqld.log and loads a schema from /var/schema.drdl, you may save a file such as the following to /etc/mongosqld.conf: \nWARNING All paths specified

 You may then start mongosqld with the --config option: mongosqld --config /etc/mongosqld.conf  For more information on starting mongosqld as a system service, see the Installation Guide for your operating system. \nUSAGE WITH ATLAS \nAtlas is a cloud service for running, monitoring, and maintaining MongoDB deployments, including the provisioning of dedicated servers for the MongoDB instances. Atlas uses TLS/SSL to encrypt connections and enforces authentication by default. \nNOTE With the MongoDB Atlas free tier, BI Connector cannot run aggregation pipelines using the allowDiskUse option. This option allows aggregation stages to write data as temporary files to disk. To review the MongoDB Atlas free tier constraints, see the MongoDB Atlas manual. mongosqld can use any valid TLS certificate issued by a certificate authority, or a self-signed certificate. If you use a self-signed certificate, although the communications channel will be encrypted, there will be no validation of server identity. Although such a situation will prevent eavesdropping on the connection, it leaves you vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Using a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority will permit your MySQL client to verify the server's identity. For testing purposes, you can create a .pem key file named test.pem using the openssl tool: openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout test.key -out test.crt -x509 -days 365 -subj \"/C=US/ST=test/L=test/O=test Security/OU=IT Department/CN=test.com\"cat test.crt test.key > test.pem  Start mongosqld with the following options:  * --mongo-ssl  * --auth  * --sslPEMKeyFile  * --mongo-uri  * --sslMode  * --mongo-username  * --mongo-password If you named your key file test.pem as in the previous example, you can run the following, substituting your cluster URI and login credentials: mongosqld --mongo-ssl \\          --auth \\          --sslPEMKeyFile test.pem \\          --mongo-uri <uri> \\          --sslMode allowSSL \\          --mongo-username <username> \\          --mongo-password <password>  Pass your username, password, and authentication database to your SQL client. For example, using mysql without verifying your mongosqld server certificate: mysql --host <mongosqld-host> --port <mongosqld-port> -u <username>?source=admin -p --ssl-mode required --enable-cleartext-plugin  Refer to Connect from the MySQL Client for more details on using the mysql client with the BI Connector. \nSAMPLING MODE REFERENCE CHART \nThe chart below describes types of mongosqld startup configurations and the options used with each. Mode\nmongosqld Options\nBehavior\nStandalone Schema  * --schemaMode not used  * --schemaSource not used mongosqld samples data upon startup. If --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs > 0, resample at specified interval. \nEXAMPLE mongosqld --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs 3600  For more information, see Standalone Schema Mode (Cached Sampling). Custom Schema  * --schemaMode custom  * --schemaSource <dbName>  * --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs not used Read schema data from the database specified by --schemaSource. \nEXAMPLE mongosqld --schemaMode
