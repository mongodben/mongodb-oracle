Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nMONGODB CONNECTOR FOR SPARK \nThe MongoDB Connector for Spark provides integration between MongoDB and Apache Spark. \nNOTE Version 10.x of the MongoDB Connector for Spark is an all-new connector based on the latest Spark API. Install and migrate to version 10.x to take advantage of new capabilities, such as tighter integration with Spark Structured Streaming. Version 10.x uses the new namespace com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.MongoTableProvider. This allows you to use old versions of the connector (versions 3.x and earlier) in parallel with version 10.x. To learn more about the new connector and its advantages, see the MongoDB announcement blog post. With the connector, you have access to all Spark libraries for use with MongoDB datasets: Datasets for analysis with SQL (benefiting from automatic schema inference), streaming, machine learning, and graph APIs. You can also use the connector with the Spark Shell.

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nFAQ  HOW CAN I ACHIEVE DATA LOCALITY? \nFor any MongoDB deployment, the Mongo Spark Connector sets the preferred location for a DataFrame or Dataset to be where the data is:      * For a non sharded system, it sets the preferred location to be the hostname(s) of the standalone or the replica set.  * For a sharded system, it sets the preferred location to be the hostname(s) of the shards. To promote data locality,  * Ensure there is a Spark Worker on one of the hosts for non-sharded system or one per shard for sharded systems.  * Use a nearest read preference to read from the local mongod.  * For a sharded cluster, you should have a mongos on the same nodes and use localThreshold configuration to connect to the nearest mongos. To partition the data by shard use the ShardedPartitioner Configuration. \nHOW DO I RESOLVE UNRECOGNIZED PIPELINE STAGE NAME ERROR? \nIn MongoDB deployments with mixed versions of mongod, it is possible to get an Unrecognized pipeline stage name: '$sample' error.

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector To create a DataFrame, first create a SparkSession object, then use the object's createDataFrame() function. In the following example, createDataFrame() takes a list of tuples containing names and ages, and a list of column names: people = spark.createDataFrame([(\"Bilbo Baggins\",  50), (\"Gandalf\", 1000), (\"Thorin\", 195), (\"Balin\", 178), (\"Kili\", 77),   (\"Dwalin\", 169), (\"Oin\", 167), (\"Gloin\", 158), (\"Fili\", 82), (\"Bombur\", None)], [\"name\", \"age\"])  Write the people DataFrame to the MongoDB database and collection specified in the spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri option by using the write method: people.write.format(\"mongodb\").mode(\"append\").save()  The above operation writes to the MongoDB database and collection specified in the spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri option when you connect to the pyspark shell. To read the contents of the DataFrame, use the show() method. people.show()  In the pyspark shell, the operation prints the following output: +-------------+----+|         name| age|+-------------+----+|Bilbo Baggins|  50||      Gandalf|1000||       Thorin| 195||        Balin| 178||         Kili|  77||       Dwalin| 169||          Oin| 167||        Gloin| 158||         Fili|  82||       Bombur|null|+-------------+----+  The printSchema() method prints out the DataFrame's schema: people.printSchema()  In the pyspark shell, the operation prints the following output: root |-- _id: struct (nullable = true) |    |-- oid: string (nullable = true) |-- age: long (nullable = true) |-- name: string (nullable = true)  If you need to write to a different MongoDB collection, use the .option() method with .write().

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nIMPORTANT In version 10.0.0 and later of the Connector, use the format mongodb to read from and write to MongoDB: df = spark.read.format(\"mongodb\").load() \nPYTHON SPARK SHELL \nThis tutorial uses the pyspark shell, but the code works with self-contained Python applications as well. When starting the pyspark shell, you can specify:      * the --packages option to download the MongoDB Spark Connector package. The following package is available:\n   \n   * mongo-spark-connector  * the --conf option to configure the MongoDB Spark Connnector. These settings configure the SparkConf object.\n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   When specifying the Connector configuration via SparkConf, you must prefix the settings appropriately. For details and other available MongoDB Spark Connector options, see the Configuration Options. The following example starts the pyspark shell from the command line: ./bin/pyspark --conf \"spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.myCollection?readPreference=primaryPreferred\" \\              --conf \"spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.myCollection\" \\              --packages org.mongodb.spark:mongo-spark-connector_2.12:10.1.1   * The spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri specifies the MongoDB server address (127.0.0.1), the database to connect (test), and the collection (myCollection) from which to read data, and the read preference.  * The spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri specifies the MongoDB server address (127.0.0.1), the database to connect (test), and the collection (myCollection) to which to write data. Connects to port 27017 by default.  * The packages option specifies the Spark Connector's Maven coordinates, in the format groupId:artifactId:version. The examples in this tutorial will use this database and collection. \nCREATE A SPARKSESSION OBJECT  NOTE When you start pyspark you get a SparkSession object called spark by default. In a standalone Python application, you need to create your SparkSession object explicitly, as show below. If you specified the spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri and spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri configuration options when you started pyspark, the default SparkSession object uses them. If you'd rather create your own SparkSession object from within pyspark, you can use SparkSession.builder and specify different configuration options. from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nmy_spark = SparkSession \\    .builder \\    .appName(\"myApp\") \\    .config(\"spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri\", \"mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.coll\") \\    .config(\"spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri\", \"mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.coll\") \\    .getOrCreate()  You can use a SparkSession object to write data to MongoDB, read data from MongoDB, create DataFrames, and perform SQL operations.

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nFILTERS \nWhen using filters with DataFrames or Datasets, the underlying MongoDB Connector code constructs an aggregation pipeline to filter the data in MongoDB before sending it to Spark. This improves Spark performance by retrieving and processing only the data you need. MongoDB Spark Connector turns the following filters into aggregation pipeline stages:      * And  * EqualNullSafe  * EqualTo  * GreaterThan  * GreaterThanOrEqual  * In  * IsNull  * LessThan  * LessThanOrEqual  * Not  * Or  * StringContains  * StringEndsWith  * StringStartsWith Use filter() to read a subset of data from your MongoDB collection. Consider a collection named fruit that contains the following documents: { \"_id\" : 1, \"type\" : \"apple\", \"qty\" : 5 }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"type\" : \"orange\", \"qty\" : 10 }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"type\" : \"banana\", \"qty\" : 15 }  First, set up a DataFrame to connect with your default MongoDB data source: df = spark.read.format(\"mongodb\").load()  The following example includes only records in which

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector You can create a Spark DataFrame to hold data from the MongoDB collection specified in the spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri option which your SparkSession option is using. Consider a collection named fruit that contains the following documents: { \"_id\" : 1, \"type\" : \"apple\", \"qty\" : 5 }{ \"_id\" : 2, \"type\" : \"orange\", \"qty\" : 10 }{ \"_id\" : 3, \"type\" : \"banana\", \"qty\" : 15 }  Assign the collection to a DataFrame with spark.read() from within the pyspark shell. df = spark.read.format(\"mongodb\").load()  Spark samples the records to infer the schema of the collection. df.printSchema()  The above operation produces the following shell output: root |-- _id: double (nullable = true) |-- qty: double (nullable = true) |-- type: string (nullable = true)  If you need to read from a different MongoDB collection, use the .option method when reading data into a DataFrame.

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nCONFIGURATION OPTIONS \nOn this page    \n * Specify Configuration\n   \n * Cache Configuration\n * ConfigExceptions Various configuration options are available for the MongoDB Spark Connector. To learn more about the options you can set, see Write Configuration Options and Read Configuration Options. \nSPECIFY CONFIGURATION  USING SPARKCONF \nYou can specify configuration options with SparkConf using any of the following approaches:       * The --conf flag at runtime. To learn more, see Dynamically Loading Spark Properties in the Spark documentation.  * The $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-default.conf file. The MongoDB Spark Connector will use the settings in SparkConf as defaults. \nIMPORTANT When setting configurations with SparkConf, you must prefix the configuration options. Refer to Write Configuration Options and Read Configuration Options for the specific prefixes. \nUSING AN OPTIONS MAP \nIn the Spark API, the DataFrameReader and DataFrameWriter methods accept options in the form of a Map[String, String]. Options specified this way override any corresponding settings in SparkConf.  \nSHORT-FORM SYNTAX \nOptions maps support short-form syntax. You may omit the prefix when specifying an option key string. \nEXAMPLE The following syntaxes are equivalent to one another:  * dfw.option(\"spark.mongodb.write.collection\", \"myCollection\").save()  * dfw.option(\"spark.mongodb.collection\", \"myCollection\").save()  * dfw.option(\"collection\", \"myCollection\").save() \nUSING A SYSTEM PROPERTY \nThe connector provides a cache for MongoClients which can only be configured with a System Property. See Cache Configuration. \nCACHE CONFIGURATION \nThe MongoConnector includes a cache for MongoClients, so workers can share the MongoClient across threads. \nIMPORTANT As the cache is setup before the Spark Configuration is available, the cache can only be configured with a System Property. System Property name\nDescription\nmongodb.keep_alive_ms The length of time to keep a MongoClient available for sharing. Default: 5000 \nCONFIGEXCEPTIONS \nA configuration error throws a ConfigException.

If you use this optional setting, you must specify a non-negative integer. \nFor more information on wTimeoutMS values, see the MongoDB server guide on the WriteConcern wtimeout option.\nupsertDocument\nWhen true, replace and update operations will insert the data if no match exists. \nFor time series collections, you must set upsertDocument to false. \nDefault: true\nconvertJson\nWhen true, the connector parses the string and converts extended JSON into BSON. \nDefault: false \nCONNECTION.URI CONFIGURATION SETTING \nYou can set all Write Configuration via the write connection.uri. \nNOTE If you use SparkConf to set the connector's write configurations, prefix spark.mongodb.write. to the setting. spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.myCollection  The configuration corresponds to the following separate configuration settings: spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/ spark.mongodb.write.database=test spark.mongodb.write.collection=myCollection  If you specify a setting both in the connection.uri and in a separate configuration, the connection.uri setting overrides the separate setting. For example, given the following configuration, the database for the connection is foobar: spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/foobar spark.mongodb.write.database=bar \n←

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nIMPORTANT In version 10.0.0 and later of the Connector, use the format mongodb to read from and write to MongoDB: df = spark.read.format(\"mongodb\").load() \nDEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT \nProvide the Spark Core, Spark SQL, and MongoDB Spark Connector dependencies to your dependency management tool. Beginning in version 3.2.0, Apache Spark supports both Scala 2.12 and 2.13. Spark 3.1.3 and previous versions support only Scala 2.12. To provide support for both Scala versions, version 10.1.1 of the Spark Connector produces two artifacts:      * org.mongodb.spark:mongo-spark-connector_2.12:10.1.1 is compiled against Scala 2.12, and supports Spark 3.1.x and above.  * org.mongodb.spark:mongo-spark-connector_2.13:10.1.1 is compiled against Scala 2.13, and supports Spark 3.2.x and above. \nIMPORTANT Use the Spark Connector artifact that's compatible with your versions of Scala and Spark. The following excerpt from a Maven pom.xml file shows how to include dependencies compatible with Scala 2.12: <dependencies>  <dependency>    <groupId>org.mongodb.spark</groupId>    <artifactId>mongo-spark-connector_2.12</artifactId>    <version>10.1.1</version>  </dependency>  <dependency>    <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>    <artifactId>spark-core_2.12</artifactId>    <version>3.3.1</version>  </dependency>  <dependency>    <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>    <artifactId>spark-sql_2.12</artifactId>    <version>3.3.1</version>  </dependency></dependencies>  \nCONFIGURATION \nWhen specifying the Connector configuration via SparkSession, you must prefix the settings appropriately. For details and other available MongoDB Spark Connector options, see the Configuration Options. package com.mongodb.spark_examples;\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession;\npublic final class GettingStarted {\n  public static void main(final String[] args) throws InterruptedException {    /* Create the SparkSession.     * If config arguments are passed from the command line using --conf,     * parse args for the values to set.     */    SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder()      .master(\"local\")      .appName(\"MongoSparkConnectorIntro\")      .config(\"spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri\", \"mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.myCollection\")      .config(\"spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri\", \"mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.myCollection\")      .getOrCreate();\n    // Application logic\n  }}   * The spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri specifies the MongoDB server address(127.0.0.1), the database to connect (test), and the collection (myCollection) from which to read data, and the read preference.  * The spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri specifies the MongoDB server address(127.0.0.1), the database to connect (test), and the collection (myCollection) to which to write data. You can use a SparkSession object to write data to MongoDB, read data from MongoDB, create Datasets, and perform SQL operations.

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector Use your local SparkSession's read method to create a DataFrame representing a collection. \nNOTE DataFrame does not exist as a class in the Java API. Use Dataset<Row> to reference a DataFrame. The following example loads the collection specified in the SparkConf: Dataset<Row> df = spark.read().format(\"mongodb\").load(); // Uses the SparkConf for configuration  To specify a different collection, database, and other read configuration settings, use the option method: Dataset<Row> df = spark.read().format(\"mongodb\").option(\"database\", \"<example-database>\").option(\"collection\", \"<example-collection>\").load();  \nSCHEMA INFERENCE \nWhen you load a Dataset or DataFrame without a schema, Spark samples the records to infer the schema of the collection.

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nIMPORTANT In version 10.0.0 and later of the Connector, use the format mongodb to read from and write to MongoDB: df = spark.read.format(\"mongodb\").load() \nSPARK SHELL \nWhen starting the Spark shell, specify:      * the --packages option to download the MongoDB Spark Connector package. The following package is available:\n   \n   * mongo-spark-connector  * the --conf option to configure the MongoDB Spark Connnector. These settings configure the SparkConf object.\n   \n   \n   NOTE\n   \n   When specifying the Connector configuration via SparkConf, you must prefix the settings appropriately. For details and other available MongoDB Spark Connector options, see the Configuration Options. For example, ./bin/spark-shell --conf \"spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.myCollection?readPreference=primaryPreferred\" \\                  --conf \"spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.myCollection\" \\                  --packages org.mongodb.spark:mongo-spark-connector_2.12:10.1.1   * The spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri specifies the MongoDB server address (127.0.0.1), the database to connect (test), and the collection (myCollection) from which to read data, and the read preference.  * The spark.mongodb.write.connection.uri specifies the MongoDB server address (127.0.0.1), the database to connect (test), and the collection (myCollection) to which to write data. Connects to port 27017 by default.  * The packages option specifies the Spark Connector's Maven coordinates, in the format groupId:artifactId:version. \nIMPORT THE MONGODB CONNECTOR PACKAGE \nEnable MongoDB Connector specific functions and implicits for your SparkSession and Datasets by importing the following package in the Spark shell: import com.mongodb.spark._  \nCONNECT TO MONGODB \nConnection to MongoDB happens automatically when a Dataset action requires a read from MongoDB or a write to MongoDB. \nSELF-CONTAINED SCALA APPLICATION  DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT \nProvide the Spark Core, Spark SQL, and MongoDB Spark Connector dependencies to your dependency management tool. The following excerpt demonstrates how to include these dependencies in a SBT build.scala file: scalaVersion := \"2.12\",libraryDependencies ++= Seq(  \"org.mongodb.spark\" %% \"mongo-spark-connector_2.12\" % \"10.1.1\",  \"org.apache.spark\" %% \"spark-core\" % \"3.3.1\",  \"org.apache.spark\" %% \"spark-sql\" % \"3.3.1\")  \nCONFIGURATION \nWhen specifying the Connector configuration via SparkSession, you must prefix the settings appropriately. For details and other available MongoDB Spark Connector options, see the Configuration Options. package com.mongodb\nobject GettingStarted {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    /* Create the SparkSession.     * If config arguments are passed from the command line using --conf,     * parse args for the values to set.     */    import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\n    val spark = SparkSession.builder()      .master(\"local\")      .appName(\"MongoSparkConnectorIntro\")      .config(\"spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri\", \"mongodb://127.0.0.1/test.myCollection\")

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nSTRUCTURED STREAMING WITH MONGODB \nOn this page    \n * Overview\n   \n * Configuring a Write Stream to MongoDB\n * Configuring a Read Stream from MongoDB\n * Examples\n * Stream to MongoDB from a CSV File\n * Stream to your Console from MongoDB \nOVERVIEW \nSpark Structured Streaming is a data stream processing engine you can use through the Dataset or DataFrame API. The MongoDB Spark Connector enables you to stream to and from MongoDB using Spark Structured Streaming. \nIMPORTANT Spark Structured Streaming and Spark Streaming with DStreams are different. To learn more about Structured Streaming, see the Spark Programming Guide. \nCONFIGURING A WRITE STREAM TO MONGODB   \nCONFIGURING A READ STREAM FROM MONGODB \nWhen reading a stream from a MongoDB database, the MongoDB Spark Connector supports both micro-batch processing and continuous processing. Micro-batch processing is the default processing engine, while continuous processing is an experimental feature introduced in Spark version 2.3. To learn more about continuous processing, see the Spark documentation. \nNOTE The connector reads from your MongoDB deployment's change stream. To generate change events on the change stream, perform update operations on your database. To learn more about change streams, see Change Streams in the MongoDB manual.   EXAMPLES \nThe following examples show Spark Structured Streaming configurations for streaming to and from MongoDB. \nSTREAM TO MONGODB FROM A CSV FILE \nTo stream data from a CSV file to MongoDB:

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nFILTERS \nWhen using filters with DataFrames or Datasets, the underlying MongoDB Connector code constructs an aggregation pipeline to filter the data in MongoDB before sending it to Spark. This improves Spark performance by retrieving and processing only the data you need. MongoDB Spark Connector turns the following filters into aggregation pipeline stages:      * And  * EqualNullSafe  * EqualTo  * GreaterThan  * GreaterThanOrEqual  * In  * IsNull  * LessThan  * LessThanOrEqual  * Not  * Or  * StringContains  * StringEndsWith  * StringStartsWith The following example filters and output the characters with ages under 100: df.filter(df(\"age\") < 100).show()

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nIMPORTANT Spark Structured Streaming and Spark Streaming with DStreams are different. Spark Streaming allows on-the-fly analysis of live data streams with MongoDB. See the Apache documentation for a detailed description of Spark Streaming functionality. This tutorial uses the Spark Shell. For more information about starting the Spark Shell and configuring it for use with MongoDB, see Getting Started. This tutorial demonstrates how to use Spark Streaming to analyze input data from a TCP port. It uses Netcat, a lightweight network utility, to send text inputs to a local port, then uses Scala to determine how many times each word occurs in each line and write the results to a MongoDB collection. Start Netcat from the command line: $ nc -lk 9999  Start the Spark Shell at another terminal prompt. import com.mongodb.spark.sql._import org.apache.spark.streaming._  Create a new StreamingContext object and assign it to ssc. sc is a SparkContext object that is automatically created when you start the Spark Shell. The second argument specifies how often to check for new input data. val ssc = new StreamingContext(sc, Seconds(1))  Use the socketTextStream method to create a connection to Netcat on port 9999: val lines = ssc.socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 9999)  Determine how many times each word occurs in each line: val words = lines.flatMap(_.split(\" \"))val pairs = words.map(word => (word, 1))val wordCounts = pairs.reduceByKey(_ + _)  Create a data structure to hold the results: case class WordCount(word: String, count: Int)  Use a foreachRDD loop to collect results and write to the MongoDB collection specified in the Spark Connector configuration. The append mode causes data to be appended to the collection, whereas overwrite mode replaces the existing data. wordCounts.foreachRDD({ rdd =>  import spark.implicits._  val wordCounts = rdd.map({ case (word: String, count: Int)          => WordCount(word, count) }).toDF()  wordCounts.write.mode(\"append\").mongo()})  Start listening: ssc.start()  To give your program something to listen to, go back to the terminal prompt where you started Netcat and start typing. hello worldcats cats dogs dogs dogs  In your MongoDB collection you'll find something similar to the following: { \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"588a539927c22bd43214131f\"), \"word\" : \"hello\", \"count\" : 1 }{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"588a539927c22bd432141320\"), \"word\" : \"world\", \"count\" : 1 }{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"588a53b227c22bd432141322\"), \"word\" : \"cats\", \"count\" : 2 }{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"588a53b227c22bd432141323\"), \"word\" : \"dogs\", \"count\" : 3 }  To end your Netcat process, use ctrl-c. To end your Spark Shell session, use System.exit(0).

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector Use your local SparkSession's read method to create a DataFrame representing a collection. \nNOTE A DataFrame is represented by a Dataset of Rows. It is an alias of Dataset[Row]. The following example loads the collection specified in the SparkConf: val df = spark.read.format(\"mongodb\").load() // Uses the SparkConf for configuration  To specify a different collection, database, and other read configuration settings, use the option method: val df = spark.read.format(\"mongodb\").option(\"database\", \"<example-database>\").option(\"collection\", \"<example-collection>\").load()  \nSCHEMA INFERENCE \nWhen you load a Dataset or DataFrame without a schema, Spark samples the records to infer the schema of the collection.

Docs Home → MongoDB Spark Connector \nREAD CONFIGURATION OPTIONS \nOn this page    \n * Read Configuration\n   \n * Change Streams\n * connection.uri Configuration Setting \nREAD CONFIGURATION \nYou can configure the following properties to read from MongoDB: \nNOTE If you use SparkConf to set the connector's read configurations, prefix spark.mongodb.read. to each property. Property name\nDescription\nmongoClientFactory\nMongoClientFactory configuration key.\nYou can specify a custom implementation which must implement the com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.connection.MongoClientFactory interface. \nDefault: com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.connection.DefaultMongoClientFactory\nconnection.uri\nRequired.\nThe connection string configuration key. \nDefault: mongodb://localhost:27017/\ndatabase\nRequired.\nThe database name configuration.\ncollection\nRequired.\nThe collection name configuration.\npartitioner\nThe partitioner full class name.\nYou can specify a custom implementation which must implement the com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioner.Partitioner interface.\nSee the Partitioner Configuration section for more information on partitioners. \nDefault: com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioner.SamplePartitioner\npartioner.options.\nPartitioner configuration prefix.\nSee the Partitioner Configuration section for more information on partitioners.\nsampleSize\nThe number of documents to sample from the collection when inferring\nthe schema. \nDefault: 1000\nsql.inferSchema.mapTypes.enabled\nWhether to enable Map types when inferring the schema.\nWhen enabled, large compatible struct types are inferred to a MapType instead. \nDefault: true\nsql.inferSchema.mapTypes.minimum.key.size\nMinimum size of a StructType before inferring as a MapType. \nDefault: 250\naggregation.pipeline\nSpecifies a custom aggregation pipeline to apply to the collection before sending data to Spark.\nThe value must be either an extended JSON single document or list of documents.\nA single document should resemble the following: {\"$match\": {\"closed\": false}} \nA list of documents should resemble the following: [{\"$match\": {\"closed\": false}}, {\"$project\": {\"status\": 1, \"name\": 1, \"description\": 1}}]  \nIMPORTANT Custom aggregation pipelines must be compatible with the partitioner strategy. For example, aggregation stages such as $group do not work with any partitioner that creates more than one partition. aggregation.allowDiskUse\nSpecifies whether to allow storage to disk when running the aggregation. \nDefault: true\noutputExtendedJson\nWhen true, the connector converts BSON types not supported by Spark into extended JSON strings. When false, the connector uses the original relaxed JSON format for unsupported types. \nDefault: false \nPARTITIONER CONFIGURATIONS \nThis section contains configuration information for the following partitioners:      * SamplePartitioner  * ShardedPartitioner  * PaginateBySizePartitioner  * PaginateIntoPartitionsPartitioner  * SinglePartitionPartitioner SAMPLEPARTITIONER CONFIGURATION  NOTE If you use SparkConf to set the connector's read configurations, prefix each property with spark.mongodb.read.partitioner.options. instead of partitioner.options.. You must specify this partitioner using the full classname: com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioner.SamplePartitioner. Property name\nDescription\npartitioner.options.partition.field The field to use for partitioning, which must be a unique field. Default: _id partitioner.options.partition.size The size (in MB) for each partition. Smaller partition sizes create more partitions containing fewer documents. Default: 64 partitioner.options.samples.per.partition The number of samples to take per partition. The total number of samples taken is: samples per partiion * ( count / number of documents per partition)  Default: 10 \nEXAMPLE For a collection with 640 documents with an average document size of 0.5 MB, the default SamplePartitioner configuration values creates 5 partitions with 128 documents per partition. The MongoDB Spark Connector samples 50 documents (the default 10 per intended partition) and defines 5 partitions by selecting partition field ranges from the sampled documents.

\nWARNING This partitioner is not compatible with hashed shard keys. PAGINATEBYSIZEPARTITIONER CONFIGURATION  NOTE If you use SparkConf to set the connector's read configurations, prefix each property with spark.mongodb.read.partitioner.options. instead of partitioner.options.. You must specify this partitioner using the full classname: com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioner.PaginateBySizePartitioner. Property name\nDescription\npartitioner.options.partition.field The field to use for partitioning, which must be a unique field. Default: _id partitioner.options.partition.size The size (in MB) for each partition. Smaller partition sizes create more partitions containing fewer documents. Default: 64 PAGINATEINTOPARTITIONSPARTITIONER CONFIGURATION  NOTE If you use SparkConf to set the connector's read configurations, prefix each property with spark.mongodb.read.partitioner.options. instead of partitioner.options.. You must specify this partitioner using the full classname: com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioner.PaginateIntoPartitionsPartitioner.

You must specify this partitioner using the full classname: com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioner.SinglePartitionPartitioner. This partitioner creates a single partition. \nCHANGE STREAMS  NOTE If you use SparkConf to set the connector's change stream configurations, prefix spark.mongodb.change.stream. to each property. Property name\nDescription\nchange.stream.lookup.full.document Determines what values your change stream returns on update operations. The default setting returns the differences between the original document and the updated document. The updateLookup setting returns the differences between the original document and updated document as well as a copy of the entire updated document. \nTIP For more information on how this change stream option works, see the MongoDB server manual guide Lookup Full Document for Update Operation. Default: \"default\" change.stream.publish.full.document.only\nSpecifies whether to publish the changed document or the full change stream document. \nWhen set to true, the connector filters out messages that omit the fullDocument field and only publishes the value of the field. \nNOTE This setting overrides the change.stream.lookup.full.document setting.  Default: false \nCONNECTION.URI CONFIGURATION SETTING \nYou can set all Read Configuration via the read connection.uri setting. For example, consider the following example which sets the read connection.uri setting: \nNOTE If you use SparkConf to set the connector's read configurations, prefix spark.mongodb.read. to the setting. spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/databaseName.collectionName?readPreference=primaryPreferred  The configuration corresponds to the following separate configuration settings: spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/spark.mongodb.read.database=databaseNamespark.mongodb.read.collection=collectionNamespark.mongodb.read.readPreference.name=primaryPreferred  If you specify a setting both in the connection.uri and in a separate configuration, the connection.uri setting overrides the separate setting. For example, given the following configuration, the database for the connection is foobar: spark.mongodb.read.connection.uri=mongodb://127.0.0.1/foobarspark.mongodb.read.database=bar \n←  Write
